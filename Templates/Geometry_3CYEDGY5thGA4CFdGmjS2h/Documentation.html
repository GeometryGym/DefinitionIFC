<p>
	Provision of a product representation as a shape representation of the <em>element</em>. It combines all specific geometry concepts, and the ability of handling multiple shape representations of the <em>element</em>.</p>
<p>
	Each individual shape representation shall be classified by the correct</p>
<ul>
	<li>
		representation identifier</li>
	<li>
		representation type</li>
</ul>
<p>
	and the assignment to the correct representation contexts. It shall only include geometric representation items that conform to the representation type.</p>
