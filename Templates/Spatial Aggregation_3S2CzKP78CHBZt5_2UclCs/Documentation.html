<p>
	Provision of a spatial structure of the project by aggregating spatial structure elements. The spatial structure is a hierarchical tree of spatial structure elements (site, building, storey, space) ultimately assigned to the project. Composition refers to the relationship to a higher level element (e.g. this storey is part of a building), decomposition refers to the relationship to lower level elements (e.g. this storey has spaces).</p>
<p>
	The default requirements stipulated by this <strong>concept template</strong> are:</p>
<ul>
	<li>
		the order of spatial structure elements being included in the concept &quot;Spatial Structure&quot; are from high to low level: <em>IfcProject, IfcSite, IfcBuilding, IfcBuildingStorey, IfcSpace</em>.</li>
	<li>
		Composition shall only be to an element at the same, or higher level.</li>
	<li>
		Decomposition shall only be to an element at the same or lower level.</li>
</ul>
<p>
	A <strong>model view definitio</strong>n shall clearly define any further restriction to the applicability of the Composition and Decomposition. if it differs from the default.</p>
