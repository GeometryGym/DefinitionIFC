<p><u>Definition from ISO
6707-1:1989</u>:
Vertical
construction usually in masonry or in concrete which bounds or
subdivides a construction works and fulfills a load bearing or retaining
function.</p>
<p><u>Definition from IAI</u>: The wall represents a
vertical construction that bounds or subdivides spaces. Wall are
usually vertical, or nearly vertical, planar elements, often designed
to bear structural loads. A wall is however&nbsp;not required
to be load bearing. The IFC specification provides two entities for
wall occurrences:</p>
<ul> <li><i>IfcWallStandardCase</i>
&nbsp;used for
all occurrences of
walls, that have a non-changing thickness along the wall path and where
the thickness parameter can be fully described by a material layer set.
These walls are always represented geometrically by a SweptSolid
geometry, if a 3D geometric representation is assigned.</li> <li><i>IfcWall</i>
&nbsp;used for all other
occurrences of wall,
particularly for walls with changing thickness along the wall path
(e.g. polygonal walls), or walls with a non-rectangular cross sections
(e.g. L-shaped retaining walls), and walls having an extrusion axis
that is unequal to the global Z axis of the project (i.e. non-vertical
walls). </li>
</ul><blockquote><font color="#0000ff" size="-1">HISTORY

<p><u><b>Type Use Definition</b></u></p>
<p><i>IfcWall</i> (or the subtype <i>IfcWallStandardCase</i>)
defines the occuurence of any wall, common information
about&nbsp;wall types (or styles) is handled by <i>IfcWallType</i>.
The <i>IfcWallType</i>
(if present) may establish the common&nbsp;type name, usage (or
predefined) type, common material layer set, common set of properties
and common shape
representations (using <i>IfcRepresentationMap</i>). The <i>IfcWallType</i>
is attached using the <i>IfcRelDefinedByType.RelatingType</i>
objectified relationship and is accessible by the inverse <i>IsDefinedBy</i>
attribute.</p>
<p><u><b>Property Set Use Definition</b></u>:</p>
<p>The property sets relating to the <i>IfcWall</i>
are defined by the <i>IfcPropertySet</i> and attached by
the <i>IfcRelDefinesByProperties</i> relationship. It is
accessible by the inverse <i>IsDefinedBy</i> relationship.
The following property set definitions specific to the <i>IfcWall</i>
are part of this IFC release:</p>

 target="SOURCE">Pset_WallCommon</a>: common property
set for all wall occurrences</li>
</ul><p><u><b>Quantity Use Definition</b></u>:</p>
<p>The quantities relating to the <i>IfcWall</i> are
defined by the <i>IfcElementQuantity</i> and attached by
the <i>IfcRelDefinesByProperties</i>. The following
quantities are foreseen, but will be subjected to the local standard of
measurement:</p>

</tr> </tbody></table><p><u><b>Containment
Use Definition</b></u></p>
<p>The <i>IfcWall</i> (and the subtype <i>IfcWallStandardCase</i>)
as any subtype of <i>IfcBuildingElement</i>,
may participate in two different containment relationships. The first
(and in most implementation scenarios mandatory) relationship is the
hierarchical spatial containment, the second (optional) relationship is
the aggregation within an&nbsp;element assembly.</p>
<ul> <li>The <i>IfcWall </i>is
places within the
project spatial hierarchy using the objectified relationship <i>IfcRelContainedInSpatialStructure</i>,
referring to it by its inverse attribute <i>SELF\IfcElement.ContainedInStructure</i>.
Subtypes of&nbsp;<i>IfcSpatialStructureElement</i> are
valid spatial containers, with <i>IfcBuildingStorey</i>
being the default container.</li> <li>The&nbsp;<i>IfcWall</i><i>
</i>may
be aggregated into an
element assembly using the objectified relationship <i>IfcRelAggregates</i>,
referring to it by its inverse attribute <i>SELF\IfcObjectDefinition.Decomposes</i>.
Any subtype of <i>IfcElement</i> can be an element
assembly, with <i>IfcElementAssembly</i> as a special
focus subtype. <br>
In this case the wall should not be additionally contained in the
project
spatial hierarchy, i.e.&nbsp;<i>SELF\IfcElement.ContainedInStructure
</i>should be <i>NIL.</i></li>
</ul><p>The&nbsp;<i>IfcWall&nbsp;</i>may
also be
an aggregate i.e. being composed by other
elements and acting as an assembly using the objectified relationship <i>IfcRelAggregates</i>,
referring to it by its inverse attribute <i>SELF\IfcObjectDefinition.IsDecomposedBy</i>.
Components of a wall are described by instances of <i>IfcBuildingElementPart</i>
that are aggregated to form a complex wall. <br>
In this case, the contained&nbsp;<i>IfcBuildingElementPart</i>'s
should not be additionally contained in the project
spatial hierarchy, i.e. the inverse attribute <i>SELF\IfcElement.ContainedInStructure
</i>of <i>IfcBuildingElementPart </i>should be <i>NIL.</i></p>
<u><b>Geometry Use Definitions</b></u>:
<p>The geometric representation of <i>IfcWall</i> is
given by the <i>IfcProductDefinitionShape</i>, allowing
multiple geometric representations. Included are: </p>
<p><b>Local Placement</b></p>
<p>The local placement for <i>IfcWall</i> is defined
in its supertype <i>IfcProduct</i>. It is defined by the <i>IfcLocalPlacement</i>,
which defines the local coordinate system that is referenced by all
geometric representations. </p>
<ul> <li>The <i>PlacementRelTo</i>
relationship of <i>IfcLocalPlacement</i>
shall point (if given) to the local placement of the same <i>IfcSpatialStructureElement</i>
that is used in the <i>ContainedInStructure</i> inverse
attribute or to a referenced spatial structure element at a higher
level.</li> <li>If the relative placement is not used, the
absolute
placement is defined within the world coordinate system. </li>
</ul><p><b><i>Geometric Representations</i></b></p>
<p>Currently, the use of 'SweptSolid', 'Clipping', and 'Brep'
representations is supported. In addition the general representation
types 'SurfaceModel' and 'BoundingBox' are allowed. The geometry use
definition for 'BoundingBox', 'SurfaceModel' and 'Brep' is explained at
<i>IfcBuildingElement</i>. A more restricted geometry
definition is given at the level of the subtype <i>IfcWallStandardCase</i>.</p>
<p><b>SweptSolid representation</b></p>
<p>The standard geometric representation (for body) of <i>IfcWall</i>
is defined using the 'SweptSolid' representation. <font
 color="#0000ff">If
the wall body can be described by a
vertical extrusion of a polygonal footprint of the wall body (where
vertical = into the direction of the global Z axis), the subtype <i>IfcWallStandardCase
</i>should be used</font>. If the extrusion is not equal to
global Z, then the <i>IfcWall</i> with 'SweptSolid
representation should be used. The <i>IfcShapeRepresentation</i>
shall have the following values:</p>
<ul> <li><i>RepresentationIdentifier</i> :
'Body'</li> <li><i>RepresentationType</i> :
'SweptSolid'</li>
</ul><p>The following additional constraints apply to the
swept solid
representation:</p>
<ul> <li><u>Solid</u>: <i>IfcExtrudedAreaSolid</i>
is required,</li> <li><u>Profile</u>: <i>IfcArbitraryClosedProfileDef</i>
shall be supported. </li> <li><u>Extrusion</u>:&nbsp;The
extrusion axis shall be perpendicular to the swept
profile, i.e. pointing into the direction of the z-axis of the Position
of the <i>IfcExtrudedAreaSolid</i>.</li>
</ul><p><b><u>Connection Geometry</u></b></p>
<p>The connection between two walls is represented by the <i>IfcRelConnectsPathElements</i>.
The use of the parameter of that relationship object is defined at the
level of the subtypes of <i>IfcWall</i> and at the <i>IfcRelConnectsPathElements</i>.</p>
