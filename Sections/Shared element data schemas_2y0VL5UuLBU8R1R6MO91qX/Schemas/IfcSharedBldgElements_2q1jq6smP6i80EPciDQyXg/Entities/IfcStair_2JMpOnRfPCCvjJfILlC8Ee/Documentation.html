	 <P>The stair is a container entity that aggregates all components of the
		stair, it represents. The aggregation is handled via the

		related flights (<I>IfcStairFlight</I>) and landings (<I>IfcSlab</I> with type
		'Landing').</P>

	 <P><U><B>Property Set Use Definition</B></U>:</P> 
	 <P>The property sets relating to the <I>IfcStair</I> are defined by the
		<I>IfcPropertySet</I> and attached by the <I>IfcRelDefinesByProperties</I>
		relationship. It is accessible by the inverse <I>IsDefinedBy</I> relationship.
		The following property set definitions specific to the <I>IfcStair</I> are part
		of this IFC release:</P> 
	 <UL> 
		<LI><A
		  HREF="../../psd/IfcSharedBldgElements/Pset_StairCommon.xml"
		  TARGET="SOURCE">Pset_StairCommon</A>: common property set for all stair
		  occurrences</LI> 
	 </UL>
	 <P><U><B>Geometry Use Definitions</B></U>:</P> 
	 <P>The geometric representation of <I>IfcStair</I> is given by the
		<I>IfcProductDefinitionShape</I>, allowing multiple geometric representations.
		Independent geometric representations should only be used when the IfcStair is
		not defined as an aggregate. If defined as an aggregate, the geometric
		representation is the sum of the representation of the components within the
		aggregate. </P> 
	 <P><B>Local placement</B></P> 
	 <P>The local placement for <I>IfcStair</I> is defined in its supertype
		<I>IfcProduct</I>. It is defined by the <I>IfcLocalPlacement</I>, which defines
		the local coordinate system that is referenced by all geometric
		representations. </P> 
	 <UL> 
		<LI>The <I>PlacementRelTo</I> relationship of <I>IfcLocalPlacement</I>
		  shall point (if given) to the local placement of the same
		  <I>IfcSpatialStructureElement</I> that is used in the
		  <I>ContainedInStructure</I> inverse attribute or to a referenced spatial
		  structure element at a higher level. </LI> 
		<LI>If the relative placement is not used, the absolute placement is
		  defined within the world coordinate system. </LI> 
	 </UL> 
	 <P>If the <I>LocalPlacement</I> is given for the <I>IfcStair</I>, then all
		components, which are aggregated to the stair should use this placement as
		their relative placement.</P> 
	 <P><B><I>Geometric Representation</I></B></P> 
	 <P>If the <I>IfcStair</I> has components (referenced by
		<I>SELF\IfcObject.IsDecomposedBy</I>) then no independent geometric
		representation shall defined for the <I>IfcStair</I>. The <I>IfcStair</I> is
		then geometrically represented by the geometric representation of its
		components. The components are accessed via
		<I>SELF\IfcObject.IsDecomposedBy[1].RelatedObjects</I>.</P> 
	 <P>If the <I>IfcStair</I> has no components defined (empty set of
		<I>SELF\IfcObject.IsDecomposedBy</I>) then the <I>IfcStair</I> may be
		represented by an <I>IfcShapeRepresentation</I> with the RepresentationType =
		'Brep'.</P>
