	 <P><U>Definition from IAI</U>: The window style defines a particular style
		of windows, which may be included into the spatial context of the building
		model through an (or multiple) instances of <I>IfcWindow</I>. A window style
		defines the overall parameter of the window style and refers to the particular
		parameter of the lining and one (or several) panels through the
		<I>IfcWindowLiningProperties</I> and the <I>IfcWindowPanelProperties</I>.</P> 
	 <P>The window entity (<I>IfcWindow</I>) defines a particular occurrence of
		a window inserted in the spatial context of a project. The actual parameter of
		the window and/or its shape is defined at the <I>IfcWindowStyle</I>, to which
		the <I>IfcWindow</I> related by the inverse relationship <I>IsDefinedBy</I>
		pointing to <I>IfcRelDefinesByType</I>. The <I>IfcWindowStyle</I> also defines
		the particular attributes for the lining (<I>IfcWindowLiningProperties</I>) and
		panels (<I>IfcWindowPanelProperties</I>).</P>

	 <BLOCKQUOTE><FONT COLOR="#FF0000" SIZE="-1">IFC2x2 COMPATIBILITY NOTICE:
		The entity <I>IfcWindowStyle</I> is still subtyped from the
		<I>IfcTypeProduct</I> to provide upward compatibility. This is a recorded
		anomaly as all other types for building elements are now subtyped from
		<I>IfcBuildingElementType</I> and have the suffix "Type", not "Style".</FONT>

	 <P><U><B>Geometry Use Definitions</B></U>:</P> 
	 <P>The <I>IfcWindowStyle</I> defines the baseline geometry, or the
		representation map, for all occurrences of the window style, given by the
		IfcWindow, pointing to this style. The representation of the window style may
		be given by the agreed set of minimal parameters, defined for the window lining
		and the window panel(s), or it my be given by a geometric representation used
		by the <I>IfcRepresentationMap</I>. The attribute
		<I>ParameterTakesPrecedence</I> decides, whether the set of parameters can be
		used to exactly represent the shape of the window style (TRUE), or whether the
		attached <I>IfcRepresentationMap</I> holds the exact representation
		(FALSE).</P> 
	 <P><B>Interpretation of parameters</B></P> 
	 <P>The <I>IfcWindowStyleOperationTypeEnum</I> defines the general layout of
		the window style. Depending on the enumerator, the appropriate instances of
		<I>IfcWindowLiningProperties</I> and <I>IfcWindowPanelProperties</I> are
		attached in the list of <I>HasPropertySets</I>. See geometry use definitions
		there.</P>
