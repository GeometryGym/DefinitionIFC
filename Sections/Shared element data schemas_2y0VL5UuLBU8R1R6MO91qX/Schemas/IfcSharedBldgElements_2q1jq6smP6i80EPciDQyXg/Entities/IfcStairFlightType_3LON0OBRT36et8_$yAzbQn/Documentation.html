	 <P><U>Definition from IAI</U>: The element type (<I>IfcStairFlightType</I>)
		defines a list of commonly shared property set definitions of a stair flight
		and an optional set of product representations. It is used to define an stair
		flight specification (i.e. the specific product information, that is common to
		all occurrences of that product type).</P> 
	 <BLOCKQUOTE> 
		<P><FONT SIZE="-1">NOTE: The product representations are defined as
		  representation maps (at the level of the supertype <I>IfcTypeProduct</I>, which
		  gets assigned by an element occurrence instance through the
		  <I>IfcShapeRepresentation.Item[1]</I> being an
		  <I>IfcMappedItem</I>.</FONT></P></BLOCKQUOTE> 
	 <P>A stair flight type is used to define the common properties of a certain
		type of a stair flight that may be applied to many instances of that type to
		assign a specific style. Stair flight types may be exchanged without being
		already assigned to occurrences.</P> 
	 <P>The occurrences of the <I>IfcStairFlightType</I> are represented by
		instances of <I>IfcStairFlight</I>.</P>
