<p><u>Definition from IAI</u>. A description of the
door panel. A door panel is normally a door leaf that opens to allow
people or goods to pass. The parameters of the door panel define the
geometrically relevant parameter of the panel,</p>
<p>The <i>IfcDoorPanelProperties</i> are included in
the list of properties , given by attribute <i>HasPropertySets</i>
of the <i>IfcDoorStyle</i>. More information about the
door panel can be included in the same list of the <i>IfcDoorStyle</i>
using the <i>IfcPropertySet</i> for dynamic extensions. </p>

<p><u><b>Geometry Use Definitions</b></u></p>
<p>The <i>IfcDoorPanelProperties</i> does not hold
an own geometric representation. However it defines parameter, which
can be used to create the shape of the door style (which is inserted by
the <i>IfcDoor</i> into the spatial context of the
project).</p>
<p><b>Interpretation of parameters</b></p>
<p>The parameters of the <i>IfcDoorPanelProperties</i>
define a standard door panel, including (if given) a proportional width
to define non-uniform double swing (or sliding, or folding) doors. The
outer boundary of the panel is determined by the occurrence parameter
assigned to the <i>IfcDoor</i>, which inserts the <i>IfcDoorStyle</i>.
It has to take the lining parameter into account as well.</p>

      <td align="left" valign="top">For door
operation types that include more than one panel, the width of (at
least) one panel is given by a normalised ratio measure. It determines
the width of that panel, which is defined as a ratio of the overall
width of the door opening.
