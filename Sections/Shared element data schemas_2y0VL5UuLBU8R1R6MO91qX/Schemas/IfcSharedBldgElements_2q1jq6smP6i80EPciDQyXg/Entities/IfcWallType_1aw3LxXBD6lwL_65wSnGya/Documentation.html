<p><u>Definition from IAI</u>: The element type (<i>IfcWallType</i>)
defines a list of commonly shared property set definitions of a wall
and an optional set of product representations. It is used to define an
element specification (i.e. the specific product information, that is
common to all occurrences of that product type).</p> <blockquote>
<p><font size="-1">NOTE: The product representations
are defined as representation maps (at the level of the supertype <i>IfcTypeProduct</i>,
which gets assigned by an element occurrence instance through the <i>IfcShapeRepresentation.Item[1]</i>
being an <i>IfcMappedItem</i>.</font></p></blockquote>
<p>An <i>IfcWallType</i> is used to define the
common properties of a
certain type of a wall that may be applied to many instances of that
type to assign a specific style. Wall types may be exchanged without
being already assigned to occurrences.</p> <p>The <i>IfcWallType</i>
can have common material (using the inverse relationship <i>HasAssociations</i>)
or property set information (using <i>HasPropertySets</i>)
assigned. If present, it does apply equally to all occurrences of the <i>IfcWallType</i>.
Property set information may be overridden at the occurrence.</p><p>The
occurrences of the <i>IfcWallType</i> are represented by
instances of <i>IfcWall</i> and <i>IfcWallStandardCase</i>.</p>

New entity in Release IFC2x Edition 2.</font></p></blockquote>
<p><u>Informal proposition</u>:</p>
<ol><li>The material assignment, if provided using the <i>IfcRelAssociatesMaterial</i>
relationship, shall not reference the <i>IfcMaterialLayerSetUsage</i>.</li></ol>
