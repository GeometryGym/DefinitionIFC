<p> <u>Definition from IAI</u>: The element type <i>IfcPlateType</i>
defines a list of commonly shared property set definitions of a thin
planar
element and an optional set of product representations (i.e. the
specific
product information, that is common to all occurrences of that product
type).</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><font size="-1">NOTE&nbsp; The product
representations are defined as representation maps (at the level of the
supertype <i>IfcTypeProduct</i>, which gets assigned by an
element occurrence instance through the <i>IfcShapeRepresentation.Item[1]</i>
being an <i>IfcMappedItem</i>.</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p>A&nbsp;plate type is used to define the common properties
of a certain type of a plate that may be applied to many instances of
that type to assign a specific style. Plate types may be exchanged
without being already assigned to occurrences. It is used to define a
planar, or plate-like parts to be located by one or several
instances of <i>IfcPlate</i>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The occurrences of the <i>IfcPlateType</i> are
represented by instances of <i>IfcPlate</i>.</p>

<p><b>Use definition for steel members</b></p>
<p> When using the <i>IfcPlateType</i> as underlying
type for steel members
in steel construction applications the following additional conventions
apply:
</p>
<p> <u>Material association:</u><br>
The <i>IfcPlateType</i> is associated
with exactly one instance of <i>IfcMaterial</i> by the
<i>IfcRelAssociatesMaterial</i> relationship. This material
association assigns
a common material to all occurrences (<i>IfcPlate</i>) of
the
<i>IfcPlateType</i>. If an individual occurrence has an own
material assignment
(see <i>IfcPlate</i>), then that assignment overrides the
material assignment
given at the <i>IfcPlateType</i>. </p>
<p> <u>Geometric representation:</u><br>
The plate type must have a full
geometric representation, normally given by <i>IfcExtrudedAreaSolid</i>.
Possibly standardized profile names for the plate have no meaning. The
<i>IfcPlateType</i> has (at least) one representation map
assigned through the
<i>RepresentationMaps</i> relation. The representation map
has a full geometric
representation given by: </p>
<ul>
  <li><u>Solid:</u> Only <i>IfcExtrudedAreaSolid</i>
shall be supported.
  </li>
  <li><u>Profile:</u> Only <i>IfcArbitraryClosedProfileDef</i>shall
be
supported. The profile represents the contour of the plate. </li>
  <li><u>Extrusion:</u> The extrusion axis shall be
perpendicular to the
swept profile, i.e. pointing into the direction of the z-axis of the
position
of the <i>IfcExtrudedAreaSolid</i>. Since the profile
instance represents the
contour of the plate, the extrusion direction corresponds to the plate
thickness. </li>
</ul>
<p> <u>Position number:</u><br>
The position number is specified in the
attribute <i>IfcTypeProduct.Tag</i>. </p>
<p> <u>Non geometric profile properties:</u><br>
Non geometric profile
properties (for instance mechanical properties) are specified through
<i>IfcProfileProperties</i> (and its specific subtypes that
are related to the
cross section). These properties are attached to <i>IfcPlateType</i>
by the
relationship <i>IfcRelAssociatesProfileProperties</i>. If
an individual
occurrence has an own profile property assignment (see <i>IfcPlate</i>),
then
this assignment overrides the profile property assignment given in
<i>IfcPlateType</i>. </p>
<p> <u>Quantity related properties:</u><br>
Quantity related
properties,which do not relate to the profile, are specified through
<i>IfcElementQuantity</i> (and its specific subtypes).
These properties are
attached to the <i>IfcPlateType</i> by the relationship
<i>IfcRelDefinesByProperties</i>. If an individual
occurrence has an own
element quantity assignment (see <i>IfcPlate</i>), then
this assignment
overrides the quantity assignment given in <i>IfcPlateType</i>.
The following
quantities are foreseen, but will be subjected to the local standard of
measurement used: </p>
