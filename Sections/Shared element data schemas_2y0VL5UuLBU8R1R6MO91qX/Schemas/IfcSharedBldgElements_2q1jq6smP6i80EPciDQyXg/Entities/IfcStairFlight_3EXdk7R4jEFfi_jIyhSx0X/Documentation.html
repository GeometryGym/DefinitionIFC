	 <P><U>Definition from IAI</U>: Assembly of building components in a single
		"run" of stair steps (not interrupted by a landing). The stair steps and any
		stringers are included in this object. A winder is regarded as part of a stair
		flight. </P> 
	 <P>An <I>IfcStairFlight</I> is normally aggregated by a stair
		(<I>IfcStair</I>) through the <I>IfcRelAggregates</I> relationship, the stair
		flight is then included in the set of
		<I>IfcRelAggregates.RelatedObjects</I>.</P> 
	 <P>An <I>IfcStairFlight</I> normally connects the floor slab of zero to two
		different storeys (or partial storeys) within a building. The connection
		relationship between the <I>IfcStairFlight</I> and the <I>IfcSlab</I> is
		expressed using the <I>IfcRelConnectsElements</I> relationship.</P>

	 <P>The local placement for <I>IfcStairFlight</I> is defined in its
