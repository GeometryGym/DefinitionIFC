<p> <u>Definition from IAI</u>: An <i>IfcPlate</i>
is a planar and often flat part
with constant thickness. A plate can be a structural part carrying
loads between or beyond points of support, however it is not required
to be load bearing.&nbsp;The location of the plate (being
horizontal, vertical or sloped) is not relevant to its
definition (in contrary to <i>IfcWall</i> and <i>IfcSlab</i>
(as floor slab)).&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><small>NOTE &nbsp;Plates are&nbsp;normally
made of steel, other metallic material, or by glass panels. However the
definition of <i>IfcPlate</i> is material independent and
specific material information shall be handled by using <i>IfcAssociatesMaterial</i>
to assign a material specification to the <i>IfcPlate</i>.&nbsp;</small></p>
  <p><small>NOTE &nbsp;Although not necessarily, plates
are often add-on parts. This
is represented by
the <i>IfcRelAggregates</i> decomposition
mechanism used to aggregate parts, such as <i>IfcPlate</i>,
into a container element, e.g. <i>IfcElementAssembly</i>,
or <i>IfcCurtainWall</i>.&nbsp;</small> </p>
</blockquote>
<p> An instance <i>IfcPlate</i> should preferably
get its geometric
representation and material assignment through the type definition by
<i>IfcPlateType</i> assigned using the <i>IfcRelDefinesByType</i>
relationship.
This allows identical plates in a construction to be represented by the
same
instance of <i>IfcPlateType</i>. </p>

   <p><u><b>Property Set Use Definition</b></u>:</p> 
    <p>The property sets relating to the <i>IfcPlate</i> are defined by the
    <i>IfcPropertySet</i> and attached by the <i>IfcRelDefinesByProperties</i>
    relationship. It is accessible by the inverse <i>IsDefinedBy</i> relationship.
    The following property set definitions specific to the <i>IfcPlate</i> are part
    of this IFC release:
    </p> 
    <ul> 
       <li><a href="../../psd/IfcSharedBldgElements/Pset_PlateCommon.xml"
         target="SOURCE">Pset_PlateCommon</a>: common property set for all plate occurrences
</li> 
</ul> 
 <p><u><b>Containment Use Definitions</b></u></p>
<p>The <i>IfcPlate</i>, as any subtype of <i>IfcBuildingElement</i>,
may participate in two different containment relationships. The first
(and in most implementation scenarios mandatory) relationship is the
hierachical spatial containment, the second relationship is
the aggregation within an&nbsp;element assembly.</p>
<ul>
  <li>The&nbsp;<i>IfcPlate</i> is placed within
the
project spatial hierarchy using the objectified relationship <i>IfcRelContainedInSpatialStructure</i>,
referring to it by its inverse attribute <i>SELF\IfcElement.ContainedInStructure</i>.
Subtypes of&nbsp;<i>IfcSpatialStructureElement</i> are
valid spatial containers, with <i>IfcBuildingStorey</i>
being the default container.</li>
  <li>The&nbsp;<i>IfcPlate</i> may be
aggregated into an
element assembly using the objectified relationship <i>IfcRelAggregates</i>,
referring to it by its inverse attribute <i>SELF\IfcObjectDefinition.Decomposes</i>.
Any subtype of <i>IfcElement</i> can be an element
assembly, with <i>IfcElementAssembly</i> as a special
focus subtype. In this case, no additional relationship to the spatial
hierarchy shall be given (i.e.&nbsp;<i>SELF\IfcElement.ContainedInStructure</i>
= NIL), the relationship to the spatial container is handled by the
element assembly<i>.</i> </li>
</ul>
<u><b><br>
Geometry use definition<br>
</b></u>
<p>The geometric representation of <i>Ifc</i><i>Plate</i>
is given by the <i>IfcProductDefinitionShape</i>, allowing
multiple geometric representations. Included are: </p>
<p><b>Local Placement</b></p>
<p>The local placement for <i>Ifc</i><i>Plate</i>
is
defined in its supertype <i>IfcProduct</i>. It is defined
by the <i>IfcLocalPlacement</i>, which defines the local
coordinate system that is referenced by all geometric representations. </p>
<ul>
  <li>The <i>PlacementRelTo</i> relationship of <i>IfcLocalPlacement</i>
shall point (if given) to the local placement of the same <i>IfcSpatialStructureElement</i>,
which is used in the <i>ContainedInStructure</i> inverse
attribute, or to a spatial structure element at a higher level,
referenced by that.</li>
  <ul>
    <li>If the <i>IfcPlate</i> is part of an
assembly, the <i>PlacementRelTo</i> relationship of <i>IfcLocalPlacement</i>
shall point to the local placement of the container element, e.g. <i>&nbsp;IfcElementAssembly</i>,
    </li>
  </ul>
  <li>If the relative placement is not used, the absolute
placement is defined within the world coordinate system.</li>
</ul>
<p><b><i>Geometric Representations</i></b></p>
<p>Currently, the use of 'SweptSolid', 'Clipping', 'Brep' and
'MappedRepresentation' representations is supported. In addition the
general representation types 'SurfaceModel' and 'BoundingBox' are
allowed. The geometry use definition for 'BoundingBox', 'SurfaceModel'
and 'Brep' is explained at <i>IfcBuildingElement</i>.</p>
<p><b>SweptSolid Representation</b><br>
The standard geometric representation of <i>IfcPlate</i>
is defined using the 'SweptSolid' representation. The following
attribute values for the <i>IfcShapeRepresentation</i>
holding this geometric representation shall be used:</p>
<ul>
  <li><i>RepresentationIdentifier</i> : 'Body'</li>
  <li><i>RepresentationType</i> : 'SweptSolid'</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Clipping Representation</b><br>
The advanced geometric representation of <i>IfcMember </i>is
defined using the 'Clipping' geometry. The following attribute values
for the <i>IfcShapeRepresentation</i>
holding this geometric representation shall be used:</p>
<ul>
  <li><i>RepresentationIdentifier</i> : 'Body'</li>
  <li><i>RepresentationType</i> : 'Clipping'</li>
</ul>
<p><b>MappedRepresentation</b><br>
In addition to the standard geometric
representation of <i>Ifc</i><i>Plate</i> that
is defined using
the 'SweptSolid' or 'Clipping' geometry, also the
'MappedRepresentation'
shall be supported as it allows for reusing the geometry definition of
the member type at all occurrences of the same type. The following
attribute values for the <i>IfcShapeRepresentation</i>
holding this geometric representation shall be used:</p>
<ul>
  <li><i>RepresentationIdentifier</i> : 'Body'</li>
  <li><i>RepresentationType</i> :
'MappedRepresentation'</li>
</ul>
<p>The same constraints, as given for the standard 'SweptSolid'
and the advanced 'SweptSolid' and 'Clipping' geometric representation,
shall apply to the <i>MappedRepresentation</i> of the <i>IfcRepresentationMap</i>.</p>
<p></p>
<p><u><b>Use definition for steel members</b></u></p>
<p> When using the <i>IfcPlate</i> for steel members
in steel construction
applications the following additional conventions apply: </p>
<p><b>Definition by non-geometric properties</b><br>
Additional
non-geometric properties can be specified through the class
<i>IfcPropertySet</i>, which is attached to the inverse
attribute
<i>IfcObject.IsDefinedBy</i> through the objectified
relationship
<i>IfcRelDefinesByProperties</i>. This allows for attaching
country-specific
information to structural members. </p>
<p><b>Decomposition</b><br>
An instance of <i>IfcPlate</i> can be part of
a decomposition through the <i>IfcRelAggregates</i>
relationship - both as
sub-ordinate or as a super-ordinate component. </p>
<ul>
  <li>If the <i>IfcPlate</i> instance is a
sub-ordinate component (i.e. the
plate is an add-on part), its local placement shall be relative to that
of the
super-ordinate instance. </li>
  <li>As a super-ordinate component, the sub-ordinates of <i>IfcPlate</i>
can be other plates or instances of <i>IfcProxy</i>, or
    <i>IfcDiscreteAccessory</i> (like <i>IfcFastener</i>).
  </li>
</ul>
<p><b>Position number</b><br>
The position number is assigned through the
attribute <i>IfcElement.Tag</i> </p>
