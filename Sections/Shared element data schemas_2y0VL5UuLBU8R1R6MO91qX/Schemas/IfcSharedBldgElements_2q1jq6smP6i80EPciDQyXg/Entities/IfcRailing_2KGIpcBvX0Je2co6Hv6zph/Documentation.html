	 <P><U>Definition of IAI</U>: The railing is a frame assembly adjacent to
		human circulation spaces and at some space boundaries where it is used in lieu
		of walls or to complement walls. Designed to aid humans, either as an optional
		physical support, or to prevent injury by falling. A list of references to
		accessory/mounting hardware for this railing might be given by including these
		assessories (<I>IfcDiscreteAssessory</I>) through the objectified relationship
		<I>IfcRelAggregates</I>. </P>

	 <P><U><B>Property Set Use Definition</B></U>:</P> 
	 <P>The property sets relating to the <I>IfcRailing</I> are defined by the
		<I>IfcPropertySet</I> and attached by the <I>IfcRelDefinesByProperties</I>
		relationship. It is accessible by the inverse <I>IsDefinedBy</I> relationship.
		The following property set definitions specific to the <I>IfcRailing</I> are
		part of this IFC release:</P> 
	 <UL> 
		<LI><A HREF="../../psd/IfcSharedBldgElements/Pset_RailingCommon.xml"
		  TARGET="SOURCE">Pset_RailingCommon</A>: common property set for all railing
		  occurrences</LI> 
	 </UL>
	 <P><U><B>Geometry Use Definitions</B></U> </P> 
	 <P>The geometric representation of <I>IfcRailing</I> is given by the
		<I>IfcProductDefinitionShape</I>, allowing multiple geometric representations.
		Included are: </P> 
	 <P><B>Local placement</B></P> 
	 <P>The local placement for <I>IfcRailing</I> is defined in its supertype
		<I>IfcProduct</I>. It is defined by the <I>IfcLocalPlacement</I>, which defines
		the local coordinate system that is referenced by all geometric
		representations. </P> 
	 <UL> 
		<LI>The <I>PlacementRelTo</I> relationship of <I>IfcLocalPlacement</I>
		  shall point (if given) to the same <I>IfcSpatialStructureElement</I> that is
		  used in the <I>ContainedInStructure</I> inverse attribute or to a referenced
		  spatial structure element at a higher level</LI> 
		<LI>If the <I>IfcRailing</I>, however, is used by an <I>IfcStair</I> or
		  <I>IfcRamp</I>, and this container class defines its own local placement, then
		  the <I>PlacementRelTo</I> relationship of <I>IfcLocalPlacement</I> shall point
		  (if given) to the local placement of the aggregate.</LI> 
		<LI>If the relative placement is not used, the absolute placement is
		  defined within the world coordinate system. </LI> 
	 </UL> 
	 <P><B><I>Geometric Representation </I></B></P> 
	 <P>Currently the use of 'BoundingBox', 'SurfaceModel', 'Brep' and
		'MappedRepresentation' representations of <I>IfcRailing</I> are supported. The
		conventions to use these representations are given at the level of the
		supertype, <I>IfcBuildingElement</I>.</P>
