<p><u>Definition from IAI</u>: The element type (<i>IfcCurtainWallType</i>)
defines a list of commonly shared property set definitions of a curtain
wall element and an optional set of product representations. It is used
to define a curtain wall specification (i.e. the specific product
information, that is common to all occurrences of that product type).</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><font size="-1">NOTE: The product
representations are defined as representation maps (at the level of the
supertype <i>IfcTypeProduct</i>, which gets assigned by an
element occurrence instance through the <i>IfcShapeRepresentation.Item[1]</i>
being an <i>IfcMappedItem</i>.</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p>A curtain wall type is used to define the common properties of
a certain type of curtain wall that may be applied to many instances of
that type to assign a specific style. Curtain wall types may be
exchanged without being already assigned to occurrences.</p>
<p>The occurrences of the <i>IfcCurtainWallType</i>
are represented by instances of <i>IfcCurtainWall.</i></p>
