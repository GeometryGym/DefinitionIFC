	 <P><U>Definition from IAI</U>: The element type (<I>IfcRailingType</I>)
		defines a list of commonly shared property set definitions of a railing element
		and an optional set of product representations. It is used to define a railing
		specification (i.e. the specific product information, that is common to all
		occurrences of that product type).</P>

		<P><FONT SIZE="-1">NOTE: The product representations are defined as
		  representation maps (at the level of the supertype <I>IfcTypeProduct</I>, which
		  gets assigned by an element occurrence instance through the
		  <I>IfcShapeRepresentation.Item[1]</I> being an
		  <I>IfcMappedItem</I>.</FONT></P></BLOCKQUOTE> 
	 <P>A railing type is used to define the common properties of a certain type
		of railing that may be applied to many instances of that type to assign a
		specific style. Railing types may be exchanged without being already assigned
		to occurrences.</P> 
	 <P>The occurrences of the <I>IfcRailingType</I> are represented by
		instances of <I>IfcRailing</I>.</P>
