	 <P><U>Definition from IAI</U>: A description of the window panel. A window
		panel is a casement, i.e. a component, fixed or opening, consisting essentially
		of a frame and the infilling. The infilling of a window panel is normally
		glazing. The way of operation is defined in the operation type. </P> 
	 <P>The <I>IfcWindowPanelProperties</I> are included in the list of
		properties (<I>HasPropertySets</I>) of the <I>IfcWindowStyle</I>. More
		information about the window panel can be included in the same list of the
		IfcWindowStyle using the <I>IfcPropertySet</I> for dynamic extensions.</P>

	 <P>The <I>IfcWindowPanelProperties</I> does not hold an own geometric
		representation. However it defines parameter, which can be used to create the
		shape of the <I>IfcWindowStyle</I> (which is inserted by the <I>IfcWindow</I>
		into the spatial context of the project).</P> 
	 <P><B>Interpretation of parameter</B></P> 
	 <P>The parameters at the <I>IfcWindowPanelProperties</I> define a standard
		window panel. The outer boundary of the panel is determined by the occurrence
		parameter assigned to the IfcWindow, which inserts the IfcWindowStyle. It has
		to take the lining parameter into account as well. The position of the window
		panel within the overall window is determined by the <I>PanelPosition</I>
		attribute.</P>
