	 <P><U>Definition from ISO 6707-1:1989</U>: Inclined way or floor joining
		two surfaces at different levels.</P>
	 <P><U>Definition of IAI</U>: An vertical passageway which provides a human
		circulation link between one floor level and another floor level at a different
		elevation. It may include a landing as an intermediate floor slab. A ramp
		normally does not include steps (stepped ramps are out of scope for this IFC
		Release). </P> 
	 <P>The ramp is a container entity that aggregates all components of the
		ramp, it represents. The aggregation is handled via the <I>IfcRelAggregates</I>
		relationship, relating an <I>IfcRamp</I> with the related flights
		(<I>IfcRampFlight</I>) and landings (<I>IfcSlab</I> with type 'Landing').</P>

	 <P><U><B>Property Set Use Definition</B></U>:</P> 
	 <P>The property sets relating to the <I>IfcRamp</I> are defined by the
		<I>IfcPropertySet</I> and attached by the <I>IfcRelDefinesByProperties</I>
		relationship. It is accessible by the inverse <I>IsDefinedBy</I> relationship.
		The following property set definitions specific to the <I>IfcRamp</I> are part
		of this IFC release:</P> 
	 <UL> 
		<LI><A HREF="../../psd/IfcSharedBldgElements/Pset_RampCommon.xml"
		  TARGET="SOURCE">Pset_RampCommon</A>: common property set for all ramp
		  occurrences</LI> 
	 </UL>
	 <P><U><B>Geometry Use Definitions</B></U>:</P> 
	 <P>The geometric representation of <I>IfcRamp</I> is given by the
		<I>IfcProductDefinitionShape</I>, allowing multiple geometric representations.
		Independent geometric representations should only be used when the
		<I>IfcRamp</I> is not defined as an aggregate. If defined as an aggregate, the
		geometric representation is the sum of the representation of the components
		within the aggregate. </P> 
	 <P><B>Local placement</B></P> 
	 <P>The local placement for <I>IfcRamp</I> is defined in its supertype
		<I>IfcProduct</I>. It is defined by the <I>IfcLocalPlacement</I>, which defines
		the local coordinate system that is referenced by all geometric
		representations. </P> 
	 <UL> 
		<LI>The <I>PlacementRelTo</I> relationship of <I>IfcLocalPlacement</I>
		  shall point (if given) to the local placement of the same
		  <I>IfcSpatialStructureElement</I> that is used in the
		  <I>ContainedInStructure</I> inverse attribute or to a referenced spatial
		  structure element at a higher level.</LI> 
		<LI>If the relative placement is not used, the absolute placement is
		  defined within the world coordinate system. </LI> 
	 </UL> 
	 <P>If the <I>LocalPlacement</I> is given for the <I>IfcRamp</I>, then all
		components, which are aggregated to the ramp should use this placement as their
		relative placement.</P> 
	 <P><B><I>Geometric Representations</I></B></P> 
	 <P>If the <I>IfcRamp</I> has components (referenced by
		<I>SELF\IfcProduct.IsDecomposedBy</I>) then no independent geometric
		representation shall be defined for the <FONT SIZE="-1">IfcRamp</FONT>. The
		<I>IfcRamp</I> is then geometrically represented by the geometric
		representation of its components. The components are accessed via
		<I>SELF\IfcProduct.IsDecomposedBy[1].RelatedObjects</I>.</P> 
	 <P>If the <I>IfcRamp</I> has no components defined (empty set of
		<I>SELF\IfcProduct.IsDecomposedBy</I>) then the <I>IfcRamp</I> may be
		represented by an <I>IfcShapeRepresentation</I> with the RepresentationType =
		'Brep'.</P>
