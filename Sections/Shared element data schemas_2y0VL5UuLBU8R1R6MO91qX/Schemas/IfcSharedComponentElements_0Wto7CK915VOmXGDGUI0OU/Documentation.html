   The schema <I>IfcSharedComponentElements</I> provides the ability to represent
   different kinds of small parts, such as various accessories and fasteners. The
   schema contains the entity <I>IfcElementComponent</I>, a subtype of <I>IfcElement</I> from
   schema <I>IfcProductExtensions</I>, and relevant subtypes for fasteners, mechanical fasteners
   and discrete accessories along with their corresponding type objects. The schema also 
   includes special subtypes of <I>IfcFeatureElementSubtraction</I> in order to provide the 
   ability to represent building element edge forms as features.
