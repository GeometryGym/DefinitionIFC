<U>Definition from IAI:</U>
   An element component is a representation for minor items included in, added to or connecting to or between
   elements, which usually are not of interest from the overall building structure viewpoint.
   However, these small parts may have vital and load carrying functions within the construction.
   These items do not provide any actual space boundaries.
   Typical examples of <I>IfcElementComponent</I>s include different kinds of fasteners and various accessories.

<P><B>Geometry Use Definitions:</B></P>

<P>
  The geometric representation of <I>IfcElementComponent</I> is given by the <I>IfcProductDefinitionShape</I>,
  allowing multiple geometric representations. Included are:
</P>

<P><U>Local Placement</U><BR>
  The local placement for <I>IfcElementComponent</I> is defined in its supertype <I>IfcProduct</I>.
  It is defined by the <I>IfcLocalPlacement</I>, which defines the local coordinate system that is
  referenced by all geometric representations. 
</P>

<UL>
  <LI>The <I>PlacementRelTo</I> relationship of <I>IfcLocalPlacement</I> shall point (if given) to
      the local placement of the same <I>IfcElement</I> or <I>IfcElementAssembly</I>, which is
      used in the <I>Decomposes</I> inverse attribute, i.e. the local placement is defined relative to
      the local placement of the element or element assembly in which the component is contained. 
  <LI>If the relative placement is not used, the absolute placement is defined within the world coordinate system. 
</UL

<P><U>Surface Model Representation</U><BR>
  Any <I>IfcElementComponent</I> (if no further constraints are defined at the level of its subtypes)
  may be represented as a single or multiple surface models, based on either shell or face based models.
  It is ensured by assigning the value 'SurfaceModel' to the <I>RepresentationType</I> attribute of
  <I>IfcShapeRepresentation</I>. In some cases it may be useful to also expose a simple representation as
  a bounding box representation of the same complex shape.
</P>

<P><U>Brep Representation</U><BR>
  Any <I>IfcElementComponent</I> (if no further constraints are defined at the level of its subtypes)
  may be represented as a single or multiple Boundary Representation elements (which are restricted to faceted
  Brep with or without voids). The Brep representation allows for the representation of complex element shape.
  It is ensured by assigning the value 'Brep' to the <I>RepresentationType</I> attribute of
  <I>IfcShapeRepresentation</I>. In some cases it may be useful to also expose a simple representation as
  a bounding box representation of the same complex shape.
</P>

<P><U>Mapped Representation</U><BR>
  The mapped item, <I>IfcMappedItem</I>, should be used if appropriate as it allows for reusing the geometry
  definition of the equipment type at occurrences of the same equipement type. In this case the
  <I>IfcShapeRepresentation.RepresentationType</I> = 'MappedRepresentation' is used.
</P>
