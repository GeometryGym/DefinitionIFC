	 <P><U>Definition from IAI</U>: The element type
		(<I>IfcDiscreteAccessoryType</I>) defines a list of commonly shared property
		set definitions of a discrete accessory and an optional set of product
		representations. It is used to define a supporting element mainly within
		structural and building services domains (i.e. the specific type information
		common to all occurrences of that type).</P> 
	 <P>The occurrences of the <I>IfcDiscreteAccessoryType</I> are represented
		by instances of <I>IfcDiscreteAccessory</I>.</P> 
	 <P>The <I>IfcDiscreteAccessoryType</I> is a specialization of the general
		building element component type to represent different type of structural and
		building service related auxiliary elements.</P>
