 <P><U>Definition from IAI:</U>
    The element type (<I>IfcElementComponentType</I>) represents the supertype for element 
    types which define lists of commonly shared property set definitions of various small parts and       accessories and an optional set of product
    representations. It is used to define a supporting element mainly within 
    structural and building services domains (i.e. the specific type information  
    common to all occurrences of that type).</P>
