	<p><u><b>Definition from IAI</b></u>: 
	This enumeration defines the flow direction at a connection 
    point as either a Source, Sink, or both SourceAndSink:</p>
	<ul> 
		<li><b>SOURCE</b>:        A source of flow (e.g., it flows out of the connection)</li>
		<li><b>SINK</b>:          A flow sink (e.g., it flows into the connection)</li>
		<li><b>SOURCEANDSINK</b>: Both a source and sink (e.g., it flows both into and 
	    	       			      out of the connection simultaneously)</li>
		<li><b>NOTDEFINED</b>:    Undefined flow direction</li>
	</ul>
