	<p><u><b>Definition from IAI</b></u>: 
	The distribution element <i>IfcDistributionFlowElement</i> defines
	occurrence elements of a distribution system that facilitate 
    the distribution of energy or matter, such as air, water or power.</p>
    
	<blockquote>
      <font size="-1">EXAMPLEs of distribution flow elements are 
        ducts, pipes, wires, fittings, equipment, etc.
	  </font>
    </blockquote> 

	 <p>The <i>IfcDistributionFlowElement</i> utilizes the following
		capabilities mainly through inverse references to objectified
		relationships:</p> 
	 <ul> 
		<li>Grouping - being part of a logical group of objects</li> 
		<li>Classification - assigned reference to an external
		  classification</li> 
		<li>Documentation - assigned reference to an external documentation</li> 
		<li>Type - reference to the product type information for the element
		  occurrence</li> 
		<li>Properties - reference to all attached properties, including
		  quantities</li> 
		<li>Cost control - reference to cost elements associated with this
		  distribution element</li> 
		<li>Work processes - reference to work tasks, in which this distribution
		  element participates</li> 
		<li>Aggregation - aggregated together with other elements to form an
		  aggregate </li> 
		<li>Connection - connectivity to other elements, including the definition
		  of the connection or joint</li> 
	 </ul> 

    <p>The <i>IfcDistributionFlowElement</i> defines the occurrence of a
    distribution element within the spatial context of a project. The 
    parameters that define the type of the distribution element and/or its 
    shape are defined by the <i>IfcDistributionFlowElementType</i> subtypes, 
    which is related by the inverse relationship IsDefinedBy pointing to 
    <i>IfcRelDefinesByType</i>.
 
<p><b><u>Property Set Use Definition</u></b>:</p>

<p>The property sets relating to this entity are defined by the <i>IfcPropertySet</i>
and attached by the <i>IfcRelDefinesByProperties</i> relationship. It is
accessible by the inverse <i>IsDefinedBy</i> relationship. The following
property set definitions specific to this entity are part of this IFC release: </p>

<ul>
 <li><a href="../../psd/IfcSharedBldgServiceElements/Pset_DistributionFlowElementCommon.xml"
     target=SOURCE>Pset_DistributionFlowElementCommon</a>: common property set for 
     distribution flow element occurrences </li>

	<p><b><u>Containment Use Definition</u></b></p>

	<p>The <i>IfcDistributionFlowElement</i>, like any subtype of <i>IfcBuildingElement</i>, may 
participate in two different containment relationships. The first (and in most implementation 
scenarios mandatory) relationship is the hierachical spatial containment, the second (optional) 
relationship is the aggregation within an element assembly.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The <i>IfcDistributionFlowElement</i> is placed within the project spatial hierarchy using the 
objectified relationship <i>IfcRelContainedInSpatialStructure</i>, referring to it by its inverse 
attribute <i>SELF\IfcElement.ContainedInStructure</i>. Subtypes of <i>IfcSpatialStructureElement</i> 
are valid spatial containers, with <i>IfcBuildingStorey</i> being the default container.</li>
<li><p>The <i>IfcDistributionFlowElement</i> may be aggregated into an element assembly using the 
objectified relationship <i>IfcRelAggregates</i>, referring to it by its inverse attribute 
<i>SELF\IfcObjectDefinition.Decomposes</i>. Any subtype of <i>IfcElement</i> can be an element 
assembly, with <i>IfcElementAssembly</i> as a special focus subtype.</p> 
<p>In this case it should not be additionally contained in the project spatial hierarchy, i.e. 
SELF\IfcElement.ContainedInStructure should be <i>NIL</i>.</p></li> 
</ul>

	<p><b><u>Geometry Use Definitions</u></b></p>
	<p>The geometric representation of <i>IfcDistributionFlowElement</i> is given
    by the <i>IfcProductDefinitionShape</i>, allowing multiple geometric
    representations. If an <i>IfcRepresentationMap</i> is defined for the 
    <i>IfcFlowElementType</i> or one of its subtypes, then the <i>IfcDistributionFlowELement</i> 
utilizes it 
    through the <i>IfcMappedItem</i>. Included geometric representations are:</p>

	<p><b>Local Placement</b></p>
	<p>The local placement is defined in the supertype <i>IfcProduct</i>. It
    is defined by the <i>IfcLocalPlacement</i> which can define
    an absolute placement, relative placement, or grid reference, with each
    defining the local coordinate system referenced by all geometric 
    representations. If given, the PlacementRelTo relationship of <i>IfcLocalPlacement</i>, 
    shall point to the referenced <i>IfcProduct</i>. If the relative
    placement is not used, the absolute placement is defined
	within the world coordinate system.</p>
	<p><u>Informal propositions for local placement</u>: </p> 
	<ol> 
		<li>If the LocalPlacement is specified, 
        then all aggregated components should use this placement as
	  	their relative placement.</li> 
	</ol> 

	<p><b>Geometric Representations</b></p>

	<p>Currently, the use of 'SweptSolid', 'Clipping', 'Brep' and 'MappedRepresentation' 
representations are supported. In addition, the general representation types 'SurfaceModel' and 
'BoundingBox' are allowed. The geometry use definitions for 'BoundingBox', 'SurfaceModel' and 'Brep' 
are explained at <i>IfcBuildingElement</i>. The geometry use definitions for 'SweptSolid' and 
'Clipping' are identical to those explained in detail at <i>IfcBeam</i>.<p>


<p><b>MappedRepresentation</b></p>

<p>In addition to the standard and advanced geometric representation of 
<i>IfcFlowDistributionElement</i> that is defined using the SweptSolid or Clipping geometry, the 
MappedRepresentation shall be supported as it allows for reusing the geometry definition of the flow 
distribution element type at all occurrences of the same type. The following attribute values for the 
<i>IfcShapeRepresentation</i> holding this geometric representation shall be used:</p>
<ul>
<li><i>RepresentationIdentifier</i>: 'Body'</li> 
<li><i>RepresentationType</i>: 'MappedRepresentation'</li> 
</ul>
<p>The same constraints as those given for the standard SweptSolid and the advanced SweptSolid and 
Clipping geometric representations shall apply to the MappedRepresentation of the 
<i>IfcRepresentationMap</i>.</p>
