	<p><u><b>Definition from IAI</b></u>: 
    The element type <i>IfcDistributionFlowElementType</i> defines a list of commonly shared property
	set definitions of an element and an optional set of product representations.
	It is used to define an element specification (i.e. the specific product
	information, that is common to all occurrences of that product type).</p> 
	 
	<blockquote>
		<font size="-1">
		NOTE: The product representations are defined as
		representation maps (at the level of the supertype <i>IfcTypeProduct</i>, which
		get assigned by an element occurrence instance through the
		<i>IfcShapeRepresentation.Item[1]</i> being an
		<i>IfcMappedItem</i>.
    	</font>
    </blockquote>
    
    <p>A distribution flow element type is used to define the common properties of a
	distribution flow element that may be applied to many occurrences of that type.
	Distribution flow element types (or	the instantiable subtypes) may be exchanged 
    without being already assigned to occurrences.</p> 
	
    <p>The occurrences of the <i>IfcDistributionFlowElementType</i> are represented
	by instances of <i>IfcDistributionFlowElement</i> or its subtypes.</p>
