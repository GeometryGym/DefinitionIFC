    <p><u><b>Definition from IAI</b></u>: 
    The space thermal load <i>IfcSpaceThermalLoadProperties</i> defines all thermal losses and gains 
    occurring within a space or zone. Those losses or gains can either be requirements
	(desired values) or criteria (actual values). The thermal load source attribute defines 
    an enumeration of possible sources of the thermal load. The maximum, minimum, time series and applicable 
    value ratio values are all interpreted according to the source. The maximum and minimum values
    should not be used if time series values are provided.</p>

	<p>The <i>IfcSpaceThermalLoadProperties</i> is a statically defined property set and
	should be attached to the instance(s) of <i>IfcSpace</i> through the
	<i>IfcRelDefinesByProperties</i> relationship. If there are several different
	thermal loads occurring within a space, multiple instances of
	<i>IfcSpaceThermalLoadProperties</i> should be assigned.</p>
