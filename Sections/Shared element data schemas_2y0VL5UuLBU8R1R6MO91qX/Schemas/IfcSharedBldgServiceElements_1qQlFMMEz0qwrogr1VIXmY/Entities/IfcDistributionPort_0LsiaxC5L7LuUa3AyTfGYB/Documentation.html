<p><b><u>Definition from IAI</u></b>: The product 
<i>IfcDistributionPort</i>
defines the occurrence of a specialized port for use within the context 
of
distribution elements. Its type is defined by 
<i>IfcDistributionPortType</i> or
its subtypes.</p>

<p><b><u>Property Set Use Definition</u></b>:</p>

<p>The property sets relating to this entity are defined by the 
<i>IfcPropertySet</i>
and attached by the <i>IfcRelDefinesByProperties</i> relationship. It is
accessible by the inverse <i>IsDefinedBy</i> relationship. The following
property set definitions specific to this entity are part of this IFC 
release: </p>

<p>The images below will help present the concepts of how an 
<i>IfcDistributionPort</i>
is used to connect occurrences together in a distribution system. These
concepts will be exemplified using a duct segment connecting to a tee and
distributing air out through two connecting duct segments, as shown below 
in
Figure 1. </p>

<p>For the duct segments in this example, the concepts of the type, 
occurrence
and performance history entities would be modeled using the following 
instances
and shown in Figure 2: </p>

<ul>
 <li>The type (and representation) is defined using 
<i>IfcDuctSegmentType</i> from the <i>IfcHvacDomain</i>
     schema</li>
 <li>The occurrences (and placements) are defined using 
<i>IfcFlowSegment</i> from the <i>IfcSharedBldgServicesDomain</i> 
schema</li>
 <li>The performance history characteristics for these occurrence are 
defined using <i>IfcPerformanceHistory</i> from the 
<i>IfcControlExtension</i> schema</li>
</ul>

<p>The fitting would be represented in a similar manner using instances 
of <i>IfcDuctFittingType</i>,
<i>IfcFlowFitting</i> and <i>IfcPerformanceHistory</i> for the type, 
occurrence
and performance history entities respectively. Figure 3 includes all the 
type
and occurrence entities that are involved in the duct and fitting 
example, as
well as how the property sets defining type are related. Also included is 
how a
port is involved in the connectivity of these entities. </p>

<p>If we look specifically at the point in the example where the duct 
segment
connects to the inlet of the tee fitting, as shown in Figure 4, there is 
a port
on the duct and a port on the tee which are used to logically relate the 
two
together so that a connection is inferred. This connection may be 
physically
realized with a specific fitting that is used to physically connect the 
duct
segment and the tee fitting, such as a flange or coupling. <br>
</br>It is important to note that the notion of a port is different from 
that
of a connector. </p>
