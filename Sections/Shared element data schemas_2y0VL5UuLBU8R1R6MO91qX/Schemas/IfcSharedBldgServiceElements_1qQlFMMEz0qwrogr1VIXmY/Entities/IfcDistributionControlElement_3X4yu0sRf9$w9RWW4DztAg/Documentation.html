	<p><u><b>Definition from IAI</b></u>: 
	The distribution element <i>IfcDistributionControlElement</i> defines
	occurrence elements of a building automation control system that are used to 
    impart control over elements of a distribution system.</p>

	<p>This class defines elements of a building automation control system. These
    are typically used to control distribution system elements to maintain 
    temperature, humidity, pressure, 
    flow, power, lighting levels, etc., through the modulation, staging or sequencing 
    of mechanical or electrical devices. The three general functional categories of 
    ControlElements as defined for this release of the IFC model are as follows:</p>

	<ul> 
		<li>Impart control over flow control elements (<i>IfcFlowController</i>) in a 
        distribution system such as dampers, valves, relays, etc., typically through 
        the use of actuation (<i>IfcActuator</i>: See <i>IfcHvacDomain</i> schema).</li>
		
        <li>Sensing elements (<i>IfcSensor</i>: See <i>IfcHvacDomain</i> schema) that measure changes 
        in the controlled variable (e.g., temperature, humidity, pressure, flow, 
        etc.).</li>

		<li>Controllers (<i>IfcController</i>: See <i>IfcHvacDomain</i> schema) typically classified 
        according to the control action they seek to perform and generally responsible 
        for making decisions about the elements under control.</li>
	</ul>
    
	<p>Since this class and its subtypes typically relate to many different distribution
    flow elements (<i>IfcDistributionFlowElement</i>), the objectified relationship 
    <i>IfcRelFlowControlElements</i> has been provided to relate control and flow elements 
    as required.</p>

	<p><u>Geometry Use Definitions</u></p>
	<p>The geometric representation of <i>IfcControlElement</i> is given
    by the <i>IfcProductDefinitionShape</i>, allowing multiple geometric
    representations. Included are:</p>

	<p><b>Local Placement</b></p>
	<p>The local placement is defined in the supertype <i>IfcProduct</i>. It
    is defined by a subtype of <i>IfcObjectPlacement</i> which can define
    an absolute placement, relative placement, or grid reference, with each
    defining the local coordinate system referenced by all geometric 
    representations. The PlacementRelTo relationship of <i>IfcLocalPlacement</i>, 
    if given, shall point to the same <i>IfcSpatialStructureElement</i> which 
    is used in the ContainedInStructure inverse attribute, or to a referenced
    spatial structure element at a higher level. If the relative
    placement is not used, the absolute placement is defined
	within the world coordinate system.</p>
	<p><u>Informal propositions for local placement</u>: </p> 
	<ol> 
		<li>If the LocalPlacement is specified, 
        then all aggregated components should use this placement as
	  	their relative placement.</li> 
	</ol> 

	<p><b>Standard Geometric Representation</b></p>
	<p>Currently, the use of attribute driven geometry for this class
    is not supported.  The standard geometric representation is
    defined using explicit geometry.</p>

	<p><b>B-Rep Representation </b></p>
	<p>The faceted B-Rep capabilities (with or without voids) shall be
    supported for B-Rep representation.</p>
