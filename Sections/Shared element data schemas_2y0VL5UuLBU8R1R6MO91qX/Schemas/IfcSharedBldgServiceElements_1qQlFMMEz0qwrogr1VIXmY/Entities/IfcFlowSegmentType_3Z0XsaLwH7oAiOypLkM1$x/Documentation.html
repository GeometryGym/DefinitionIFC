	<p><u><b>Definition from IAI</b></u>: 
    The element type <i>IfcFlowSegmentType</i> defines a list of commonly shared property
	set definitions of a flow segment and an optional set of product representations.
	It is used to define a flow segment specification (i.e. the specific product
	information, that is common to all occurrences of that product type).</p> 
	 
    <blockquote>
		<font size="-1">
		NOTE: The product representations are defined as
		representation maps (at the level of the supertype <i>IfcTypeProduct</i>, which
		get assigned by an element occurrence instance through the
		<i>IfcShapeRepresentation.Item[1]</i> being an
		<i>IfcMappedItem</i>.
    	</font>
    </blockquote>
    
    <p>A flow segment type is used to define the common properties of a
	flow segment that may be applied to many occurrences of that type.
A flow segment is a section of a distribution system, such as a duct, pipe, conduit, etc. that typically has 
only two ports. 
	Flow segment types (or the instantiable subtypes) may be exchanged 
    without being already assigned to occurrences.</p> 
	
    <p>The occurrences of the <i>IfcFlowSegmentType</i> are represented
	by instances of <i>IfcFlowSegment</i> or its subtypes.</p>
