	<p><u><b>Definition from IAI</b></u>: 
	The distribution flow element <i>IfcFlowTreatmentDevice</i> defines
    the occurrence of a device typically used to remove unwanted
    matter from a fluid, either liquid or gas, and typically participates
    in a flow distribution system (e.g., air filter).
    Its type is defined by <i>IfcFlowTreatmentDeviceType</i> or its subtypes.</p>

	<p><i>IfcFlowTreatmentDevice</i> is a container entity that aggregates all 
    components of the device it represents. The aggregation is
	handled via the <i>IfcRelAggregates</i> relationship.</p> 
    
    <p><u><b>Property Set Use Definition</b></u>:</p> 
    <p>The property sets relating to this entity are defined by the

	<p><u>Geometry Use Definitions</u></p>
	<p>The geometric representation of <i>IfcFlowTreatmentDevice</i> is given
    by the <i>IfcProductDefinitionShape</i>, allowing multiple geometric
    representations. Included are:</p>

	<p><b>Local Placement</b></p>
	<p>The use of local placement is defined at the supertype 
    <i>IfcDistributionFlowElement</i>.</p>

	<p><b>Standard Geometric Representation</b></p>
	<p>The use of Standard Geometric Representations is defined at the supertype 
    <i>IfcDistributionFlowElement</i>.</p>
