	 <P>The <I>IfcSharedMgmtElements</I> schema defines basic concepts that are
		common to management throughout the various stages of the building lifecycle.
		The primary classes in the schema are all subtypes of <I>IfcControl</I> and act
		to manage or regulate the conduct of the project in some way. This schema,
		along with <I>IfcProcessExtension</I> and <I>IfcConstructionMgmtDomain</I>,
		provide a set of models that can be used by applications needing to share
		information concerning management related issues.</P> 
	 <H2>Scope</H2> 
	 <P>The objective of the IfcSharedMgmtElements schema is to capture
		information that supports the ordering of work and components, the development
		of cost schedules and the association of environmental impact information. The
		aim is to provide support for exchange and sharing of minimal information
		concerning the subjects in scope; the extent of the model will not support the
		more detailed ideas found in more specialized management applications.</P> 
	 <P>The following are within the scope of this part of the
		specifications:</P> 
	 <UL> 
		<LI>Principal types of order that may be used in the project and whose
		  details need to be captured for the project including purchase orders, change
		  orders and work orders.</LI> 
		<LI>Schedules of costs.</LI> 
		<LI>Association of cost and environmental impact of information to
		  specific objects as required.</LI> 
	 </UL> 
	 <P>The following are outside of the scope of this part of the
		specifications:</P> 
	 <UL> 
		<LI>Transaction details that may be supported by or support electronic
		  commerce.</LI> 
	 </UL> 
	 <H2>Process Usage</H2> 
	 <H3>Project Orders</H3> 
	 <P>All types of order contain a basic set of attributes that enable the
		identification of the order, who it is issued by, who it is issued to and when
		it is issued. These are the fundamental requirements of an order.</P> 
	 <P>Three types of project order are defined:</P> 
	 <UL> 
		<LI>Change Order</LI> 
		<LI>Purchase Order</LI> 
		<LI>Work Order</LI> 
	 </UL> 
	 <H4>Change Order</H4> 
	 <P>The change order provides details of when an instruction is given to
		make a change in the project. It includes a description of the change and the
		reasons for it occurring. It may relate various documents to the change
		requirement. A change order will also have date/time constraints related;
		typically including such constraints as requested start and finish time, actual
		start and finish time (times at which the change is started and finished).
		Change orders may also have associated cost representations of various types,
		each representation being related through a single relationship. A work plan
		can also be associated in which the various tasks and resources required can be
		exposed.</P> 
	 <H4>Purchase Order</H4> 
	 <P>The purchase order can handle information concerning any type of
		purchase including both component and services purchases. Individual items
		within the purchase order are referenced from a cost representation that can
		identify individual costs. The purchase order also captures some information
		about logistics including shipping method (where a component is required).</P> 
	 <H4>Work Order</H4> 
	 <P>The work order provides a general approach to capturing information
		concerning an instruction given to do work. Various individual types of work
		order may be further defined in domain schema (e.g. maintenance work
		order).</P> 
	 <H3>Cost Schedule</H3> 
	 <P>A cost schedule provides the means to bring together instances of
		<I>IfcCostScheduleItem</I> as a budget, cost plan, estimate, tender, bill of
		quantities etc.</P> 
	 <H3>Cost Schedule Item</H3> 
	 <P>A cost schedule item provides the means to define the individual items
		that form the complete cost schedule.</P>
