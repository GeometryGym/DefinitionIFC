<p>Actor attributes such as the organization to which the order
is sent, issuing organization, person responsible atc. are handled by
assigning instances of <i>IfcActor</i> through <i>IfcRelAssignsToProjectOrder</i>.
The <i>IfcActorRole</i> must be asserted with the value of
the role set when used in this context.</p>
<p>A work plan (acting as a service) may be assigned to a project
order (acting as a client) to describe how the project order should be
fulfilled. This is handled by assigning instances of <i>IfcWorkPlan</i>
through <i>IfcRelAssignsToProjectOrder</i>.</p>
<p>The reverse of this situation may be true whereby the work
plan (acting as a client) may have project orders (acting as a
service). This is handled by assigning instances of <i>IfcProjectOrder</i>
to an <i>IfcWorkPlan</i> through <i>IfcRelAssignsToControl</i>.</p>
<p>Approvals including signoff, authorization etc. are handled
using the the <i>IfcRelAssociatesApproval</i> relationship
