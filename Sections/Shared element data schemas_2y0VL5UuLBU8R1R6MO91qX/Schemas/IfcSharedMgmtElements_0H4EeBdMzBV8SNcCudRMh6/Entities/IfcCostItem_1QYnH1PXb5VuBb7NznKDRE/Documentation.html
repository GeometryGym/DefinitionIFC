	 <P><U>Definition from IAI:</U>An <I>IfcCostItem</I> describes a cost or
		financial value together with descriptive information that describes its
		context in a form that enables it to be used within a cost schedule.</P>

	 <P>An <I>IfcCostItem</I> can be used to represent the cost of goods and
		services, the execution of works by a process, lifecycle cost and much
		more.</P> 
	 <P><I>IfcCostItem</I> brings together the value and currency concepts
		available through the <I>IfcCostResource</I> schema with the identification,
		naming and descriptive powers that all non-resource entities in the model
		inherit from <I>IfcRoot</I>.</P> 
	 <P>Each instance of <I>IfcCostItem</I> may have a name and a description.
		Depending on the use for which the cost is intended, these values should be
		asserted on the basis of agreement. For instance, the name attribute could be
		used to provide a common value that enables distinct instances to be brought
		together in a nesting arrangement (see below) whilst the description attribute
		could be used to provide the typical text that would be used for item
		description in a costing schedule.</P> 
	 <P>An <I>IfcCostItem</I> can nest other instances of <I>IfcCostItem</I>
		through its relationships to <I>IfcRelNests</I>. This can be used to enable the
		development of complex groups of costs as may be found in cost schedules
		through to pages, sections and complete cost schedules. </P> 
	 <P>Instances of <I>IfcCostItem</I> can be assigned to an
		<I>IfcCostSchedule</I> through the <I>IfcRelSchedulesCostItems</I> relationship
		class.</P> 
	 <P>Instances of <I>IfcCostItem</I> are used for cost estimates, budgets,
		etc., where a variety of identification codes are used extensively to identify
		the meaning of the cost. Examples include project phase codes, CSI codes,
		takeoff sequence numbers, cost accounts, etc. The IFC model allows for all
		classes that are ultimately subtypes of <I>IfcObject</I> to inherit the ability
		to have one or more instances of <I>IfcClassificationNotation</I> to be
		assigned. Where identification codes are required, the generic IFC
		classification facility should be used.</P>
