	 <P>An <I>IfcCostSchedule</I> is ultimately a subtype of <I>IfcRoot</I> and
		consequently inherits its identifying, naming and description attributes.</P> 
	 <P>In addition to the global unique identifier, an <I>IfcCostSchedule</I>
		may be assigned a specific local unique identifier.</P> 
	 <P>The name attribute may be used to give an overall title or name to the
		<I>IfcCostSchedule</I>.</P> 
	 <P>The description attribute may be used to provide further descriptive
		narrative. This may include specific comments that can be applied.</P> 
	 <P>An <I>IfcCostSchedule</I> may be assigned a status that determines its
		current level of development or agreement. In the case of an 'APPROVED' status,
		this should only be set after an approval has been given through the
		association of an instance of <I>IfcApproval</I>.</P> 
	 <P>An <I>IfcCostSchedule</I> may also be declared as being of a particular
		type. A number of predefined types are included through the
		<I>IfcCostScheduleTypeEnum</I> enumeration. </P>
