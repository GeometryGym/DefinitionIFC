	 <P><U>Definition from IAI: </U>An <I>IfcRelAssignsToProjectOrder</I> is a
		relationship class that captures the incidence of a project order for a set of
		objects and whose occurrences can be recorded within a project record in
		sequence as a series of events.</P>

	 <P><I>IfcRelAssignsToProjectOrder</I> is a subtype of
		<I>IfcRelAssignsToControl</I>. It acts so as to assign items to a project
		order. The instance of <I>IfcProjectOrder</I> acts as the relating control
		(which is inherited from <I>IfcRelAssignsToControl</I>). </P> 
	 <P>Specific objects may be assigned to the project order via the inherited
		<I>IfcRelAssignsToControl.RelatedObjects</I> attribute. Examples are a cost
		schedule (<I>IfcCostSchedule</I>), a work plan (<I>IfcWorkPlan</I>), actors
		concerned with the project order (<I>IfcActor</I>) etc. </P> 
	 <P>It may also be relevant to assign physical components to the order to
		identify that this is the originating order for such objects. This can be
		particularly relevant in the operating phase of the facility lifecycle where
		the Facilities Manager may wish to obtain details about the original purchase
		of components. It is more efficient to achieve this through assigning the
		objects to the project order through <I>IfcRelAssignsToProjectOrder</I> rather
		than assigning the project order to each object through multiple instances of
		<I>IfcRelAssignsToProduct</I>.</P>
