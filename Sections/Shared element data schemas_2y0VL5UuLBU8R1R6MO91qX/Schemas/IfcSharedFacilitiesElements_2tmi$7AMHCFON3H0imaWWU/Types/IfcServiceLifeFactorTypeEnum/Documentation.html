	 <P> Note that the values given in the enumeration list are those indicated
		in the ISO standard relating to service life. In the standard, service life
		modification factors are identified as A to G inclusive. In the enumeration
		list, the A to G values are retained for conformance to the standard. However,
		each factor is also named according to its purpose. This semantic name is
		placed after an 'underscore' character immediately following the ISO
		factor.</P>
