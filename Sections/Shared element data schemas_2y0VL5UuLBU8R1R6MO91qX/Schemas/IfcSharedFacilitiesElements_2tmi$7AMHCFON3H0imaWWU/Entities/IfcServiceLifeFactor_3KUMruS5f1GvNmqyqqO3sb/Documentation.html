	 <P>Note that each instance of <I>IfcServiceLifeFactor</I> may have a name
		that describes the form of impact that the factor has on the service life.
		Because there is a significant list of such potential impacts, they are not
		explicitly collected together into an enumeration. In order to name an instance
		of <I>IfcServiceLifeFactor</I>, the inherited <I>Name</I> attribute should be
		used.</P> 
	 <P> Within the IFC specification, any number of service life factors may be
		allowed to impact upon the service life of an artefact. In many cases, it is
		probable that the ISO standard that specifies good practice for service life
		consideration will be applied. </P> 
	 <P> Within the ISO standard, there are seven defined (named) service life
		factors that may be applied to an <I>IfcServiceLife</I>. These are captured in
		the IfcServiceLifeFactorEnum (together with a user defined capability). Each
		factor can have three values that define an upper, lower and most used (or
		median) value.</P> 
	 <P>One or more instances of <I>IfcServiceLifeFactor</I> can be related to
		an <I>IfcServiceLife</I> through the <I>IfcRelDefinesByProperties</I>
		relationship class.</P>
