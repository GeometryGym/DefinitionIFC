<h3>Use Definitions</h3>
<p>The principal purpose of <i>IfcOccupant</i> is to
determine the nature of occupancy of a property for a particular actor.
All characteristics relating to the actor (name, organization details
etc.) are inherited from the <i>IfcActor</i> class.</p>
<p>The property to be occupied is defined by <i>IfcSpatialStructureElement</i>
and the assignment of the occupant to the property is via the <i>IfcRelOccupiesSpaces</i>
relationship class. Particular details of the agreement relating to the
occupancy of a property are dealt with in the <a
 href="../../psd/IfcSharedFacilitiesElements/Pset_PropertyAgreement.xml">Pset_PropertyAgreement</a>
that is defined for the instance of <i>IfcSpatialStructureElement</i>.
This means that an occupant may be related to a site, building,
building storey or space or to any composition of site, building,
building storey or space through the <i>IfcSpatialStructureElement.ElementComposition</i>.
For instance, if the property concerned is several office spaces on a
building storey, it might be appropriate to reference <i>IfcBuildingStorey.ElementComposition=PARTIAL</i>.</p>
<p>Occupants of a property may be considered to be the parties to
an agreement. The roles that the occupant may play in respect to an
agreement are defined in the <i>IfcOccupantTypeEnum</i>.
If the role is not specified by the predefined contents of this
enumeration, the value USERDEFINED may be set and the <i>IfcOccupant.UserDefinedOccupant</i>
attribute asserted.</p>
