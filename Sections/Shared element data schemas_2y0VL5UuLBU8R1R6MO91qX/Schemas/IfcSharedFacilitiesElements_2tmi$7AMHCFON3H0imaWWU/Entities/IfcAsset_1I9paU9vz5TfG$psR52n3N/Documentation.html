<p><u>Definition from IAI: </u>An <i>IfcAsset</i>
is a uniquely identifiable grouping of elements acting as a single
entity that has a financial value </p>
<blockquote> <font color="#0000ff" size="-1">HISTORY
New class in IFC 2x. Modified in IFC 2x2</font></blockquote>
<p><u><b>Use Definitions</b></u></p>
<p>An asset is generally the level of granularity at which
maintenance operations are undertaken. An asset is a group that can
contain one or more elements. While the value of a component or
element can be defined, value is also defined for accounting purposes
at the level of the asset. </p>
<p>There are a number of actors that can be associated with an
asset, each actor having a role. Principal actors are identified as
attributes of the class. Additional actors can be specified through the
relationship class <i>IfcRelAssignsToActor</i> in which
case roles should be defined through the <i>IfcActorRole</i>
class which must be asserted for each defined role.</p>
<p>There are a number of costs that can be associated with an
asset, each cost having a role. Principal costs are identified as
attributes of the class. Additional costs can be specified through the
relationship class <i>IfcRelAssociatesCost</i> in which
case roles must be asserted.</p>
<p>Service life data (expected life etc.) can be assigned for one
or more assets as <i>IfcServiceLife</i> through the
relationship class <i>IfcRelAssignsToControl</i>.</p>
<p>The operating function of an asset within an organization may
be particularly valuable in situations where one organization provides
and maintains core services and another organization adds and maintains
terminal services. It can classify who owns and is responsible for the
asset. Operating function can be designated through the use of one or
more classification notations which will be handled through the
relationship class <i>IfcRelAssociatesClassification</i>.</p>
<p><u><b>Property Set Use Definition</b></u>:</p>
<p>The property sets relating to an <i>IfcAsset </i>are
defined by the <i>IfcPropertySet</i> and attached by the <i>IfcRelDefinesByProperties</i>
relationship. It is accessible by the inverse <i>IsDefinedBy</i>
relationship. The following property set definitions specific to an <i>IfcAsset</i>
are part of this IFC release:</p>
<ul>
  <li><a
 href="../../psd/IfcSharedFacilitiesElements/Pset_Asset.xml">Pset_Asset</a>:
specific property set for the properties of an asset, if available </li>
  <li><a
 href="../../psd/IfcSharedFacilitiesElements/Pset_Reliability.xml">Pset_Reliability</a>:
specific property set for the properties defining risk that may be
associated with an asset or any occurrence of a subtype of <i>IfcProduct</i>,
if available </li>
  <li><a
 href="../../psd/IfcSharedFacilitiesElements/Pset_Risk.xml">Pset_Risk</a>:
specific property set for the properties defining risk that may be
associated with an asset or any occurrence of a subtype of <i>IfcObject</i>,
if available </li>
  <li><a
 href="../../psd/IfcSharedFacilitiesElements/Pset_Warranty.xml">Pset_Warranty</a>:
specific property set for the properties relating to a warranty or
guarantee that may be associated with an asset, any occurrence of <i>IfcProduct</i>
or any occurrence of <i>IfcSystem</i>, if available </li>
</ul>
<p><u><b>Geometry Use Definitions</b></u></p>
<p>The geometric representation of an <i>IfcAsset</i>
is determined by the geometric representations of the products that
comprise the asset (since an asset is a subtype of <i>IfcGroup</i>)
