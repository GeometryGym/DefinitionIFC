	 <P>Various types of inventory can be included. These are identified by the
		range of values within the inventory type enumeration which currently includes
		space, asset, furniture. User defined inventories can also be defined for lists
		of particular types of element such as may be required in operating and
		maintenance instrucions. Such inventories should be constrained to contain a
		list of elements of a restricted type. </P> 
	 <P>There are a number of actors that can be associated with an inventory,
		each actor having a role. Principal actors are identified as attributes of the
		class. Additional actors can be specified through the relationship class
		<I>IfcRelAssignsToActor</I> in which case roles should be defined through the
		<I>IfcActorRole</I> class which must be asserted for each defined role.</P> 
	 <P>There are a number of costs that can be associated with an inventory,
