<p><u>Definition from ISO/CD 10303-46:1992</u>: An
annotation fill area is a set of curves that may be filled with
hatching, colour or tiling. The annotation fill are is described by
boundaries which consist of non-intersecting, non-self-intersecting
closed curves. These curves form the boundary of planar areas to be
filled according to the style for the annotation fill area.</p>
<blockquote><small> </small>
  <p><small>NOTE: A curve that is not surrounded by any
other curve is a border between an unfilled area on the outside and a
filled area on the inside. Another curve may surround an unfilled area
if it is surrounded by another curve whose inside is a filled area.</small></p>

<p><u>Definition from IAI</u>: &nbsp;The <i>IfcAnnotationFillArea</i>
defines an area by a definite <i>OuterBoundary</i>, that
might include <i>InnerBoundaries</i>. The areas defined by
the <i>InnerBoundaries</i> are excluded from applying the
fill area style.</p>
<p>Informal Proposition:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Any curve that describes an inner boundary shall not
intersect with, nor include, another curve defining an inner boundary.</li>
  <li>The curve defining the outer boundary shall not intersect
with any curve defining an inner boundary, nor shall it be surrounded by
a curve defining an inner boundary.</li>
</ol>
