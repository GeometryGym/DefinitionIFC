<p><u>Definition
from IAI</u>:&nbsp;The <i>IfcAnnotationSurfaceOccurrence</i>
shall only be used within a material or paper space
dependent representation (note: paper space is not yet supported within
this IFC release).&nbsp;Styled surfaces or solids within model
space shall use <i>IfcStyledItem</i> as the instance to
link the geometric surface, solid or annotation surface (for texture
maps) representation item to the (shared) style information.</p>
<p>An <i>IfcAnnotationSurfaceOccurrence</i>
is a relation object, that assigns a (set of) styles to a
representation item. It can be used without having a geometric
representation item already assigned, e.g. within an <i>IfcMaterialDefinitionRepresentation</i>.
Each instance of <i>IfcAnnotationSurfaceOccurrence</i>&nbsp;points,
via an <i>IfcPresentationStyleAssignment</i>, to an <i>IfcSurfaceStyle</i>,
that can be shared by many styled surfaces, or solids.</p>
