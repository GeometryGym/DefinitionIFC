<p><u>
Definition from IAI</u>:&nbsp;The <i>IfcAnnotationTextOccurrence
</i>shall only be used within a material or paper space
dependent representation (note: paper space is not yet supported within
this IFC release).&nbsp;Styled text within model
space shall use <i>IfcStyledItem</i> as the instance to
link the geometric text representation item to the (shared) style
information.</p>
<p>An <i>IfcAnnotationTextOccurrence </i>is a
relation object, that assigns a (set of) styles to a
representation item. It can be used without having a geometric
representation item already assigned, e.g. within an <i>IfcMaterialDefinitionRepresentation</i>.
If it has a geometric representation item already assigned than this is
further restricted to be&nbsp;an <i>IfcTextLiteral</i><i></i>.
The applicable style information is restricted to be an&nbsp;<i>IfcTextStyle.</i>&nbsp;For
each instance of a styled text, one instance of <i>IfcAnnotationTextOccurrence</i>
has to be created, that points, via an <i>IfcPresentationStyleAssignment</i>,
to an <i>IfcTextStyle</i>, that can be shared by many
styled texts.</p>
