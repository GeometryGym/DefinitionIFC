<p><u>Definition from IAI</u>:&nbsp;The <i>IfcAnnotationSymbolOccurrence
</i>shall only be used within a material or paper space
dependent representation (note: paper space is not yet supported within
this IFC release).&nbsp;Styled symbols within model
space shall use <i>IfcStyledItem</i> as the instance to
link the geometric symbol representation item to the (shared) style
information.</p>
<p>An <i>IfcAnnotationSymbolOccurrence </i>is a
relation object, that assigns a (set of) styles to a
representation item. It can be used without having a geometric
representation item already assigned, e.g. within an <i>IfcMaterialDefinitionRepresentation</i>.
If it has a geometric representation item already assigned than this is
further restricted to be a subtype of <i>IfcDefinedSymbol</i>.
The applicable style information is restricted to be an <i>IfcSymbolStyle</i>.&nbsp;For
each instance of a styled symbol,
one instance of <i>IfcAnnotationSymbolOccurrence</i> has
to be created, that points, via an <i>IfcPresentationStyleAssignment</i>,
to an <i>IfcSymbolStyle</i>, that can be shared by many
styled symbols.</p>
