<p>The schema <i>IfcPresentationOrganizationResource</i>
defines the resources used for geometric representations and
presentations of styled items. The primary application of this resource
is for presenting the annotation occurrences of curve, text, filled
area, symbol, and surfaces. The organization resource focusses on the
provision of layer assignments and light objects.</p>
<blockquote><font color="#0000ff" size="-1">NOTE:
The definitions of this resource of the IFC model have been taken from
the International Standard 10303: "Industrial automation systems and
integration - Product data representation and exchange", Part 46
"Integrated generic resources: Visual presentation". The reference of
the final international standard is ISO/IS 10303-46:1994. The <i>IfcPresentationOrganizationResource</i>
refers to the clause 4, "Presentation organization" of the standard.</font></blockquote>
<p>The definitions taken from ISO/IS 10303-46:1994 have undergone
a adaptation process, characterized by:</p>
<ul>
  <li>adaptation of the IFC naming convention (inner majuscules
and Ifc prefix)</li>
  <li>adaptation of the STEP entities, where multiple inheritance
or non-exclusive inheritance (i.e. AND or ANDOR subtype constraints)
are used</li>
  <li>selection of a subset of the IR, using subtype and select
pruning</li>
  <li>dimensionality of geometric representation items defined at
each item (not through the representation context)</li>
  <li>omission of the name attribute at the representation item</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition to the adaptations from ISO/IS 10303-46:1994 the
following changes and additions have been made:</p>
<ul>
  <li>lighting sources have additional capabilities partially
taken from
    <ul>
      <li>ISO/IEC 14772-1: 1997: The Virtual Reality Modeling
Language (VRML) specification</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>The semantic definitions of <i>IfcPresentationAppearanceResource</i>
are defined following the adaptation of the <b>ISO/CD
10303-46:1992</b>, <i>Industrial Automation Systems and
Integration: Product Data Representation and Exchange - Part 46:
Integrated Generic Resources. Visual presentation</i>. The type,
class, and function semantic definition sections follow the adapted
wording of the working draft, which is clearly indicated and quoted at
each reference. </p>
<p>The definitions of all parts of the <i>IfcPresentationAppearanceResource</i>,
that are taken from ISO10303-46, or ISO/IEC 14772-1, are explicitly
excluded from the copyright of the International Alliance of
Interoperability. </p>
