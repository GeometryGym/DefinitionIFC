	 <P><U>Definition from ISO/CD 10303-46:1992</U>: The light source positional
		entity is a subtype of light source. This entity has a light source position
		and attenuation coefficients. A positional light source affects a surface based
		on the surface's orientation and position.</P> 
	 <P><U>Definition from ISO/IEC 14772-1:1997</U>: The Point light node
		specifies a point light source at a 3D location in the local coordinate system.
		A point light source emits light equally in all directions; that is, it is
		omnidirectional. Point light nodes are specified in the local coordinate system
		and are affected by ancestor transformations. </P> 
	 <P>Point light node's illumination falls off with distance as specified by
		three attenuation coefficients. The attenuation factor is </P>

	 <P>where r is the distance from the light to the surface being illuminated.
		The default is no attenuation. An attenuation value of (0, 0, 0) is identical
		to (1, 0, 0). Attenuation values shall be greater than or equal to zero. </P>
