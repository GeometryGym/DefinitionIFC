	 <P><U>Definition from ISO/CD 10303-46:1992</U>: The light source
		directional is a subtype of light source. This entity has a light source
		direction. With a conceptual origin at infinity, all the rays of the light are
		parallel to this direction. This kind of light source lights a surface based on
		the surface's orientation, but not position.</P> 
	 <P><U>Definition from ISO/IEC 14772-1:1997</U>: The directional light node
		defines a directional light source that illuminates along rays parallel to a
		given 3-dimensional vector. Directional light nodes do not attenuate with
		distance. Directional light nodes are specified in the local coordinate system
		and are affected by ancestor transformations.</P>
