	 <P><U>Definition from ISO/CD 10303-46:1992</U>: The light source spot
		entity is a subtype of light source. Spot light source entities have a light
		source colour, position, direction, attenuation coefficients, concentration
		exponent, and spread angle. If a point lies outside the cone of influence of a
		light source of this type as determined by the light source position, direction
		and spread angle its colour is not affected by that light source.</P>

		<P><FONT SIZE="-1">NOTE: The <I>IfcLightSourceSpot</I> adds the
		  <I>BeamWidthAngle</I> which defines the inner cone in which the light source
		  emits light at uniform full intensity. The light source's emission intensity
		  drops off from the inner solid angle (<I>BeamWidthAngle</I>) to the outer solid
		  angle (<I>SpreadAngle</I>).</FONT></P></BLOCKQUOTE> 
	 <P><U>Definition from ISO/IEC 14772-1:1997</U>: The Spot light node defines
		a light source that emits light from a specific point along a specific
		direction vector and constrained within a solid angle. Spot lights may
		illuminate geometry nodes that respond to light sources and intersect the solid
		angle defined by the Spot light. Spot light nodes are specified in the local
		coordinate system and are affected by ancestors' transformations.</P>
