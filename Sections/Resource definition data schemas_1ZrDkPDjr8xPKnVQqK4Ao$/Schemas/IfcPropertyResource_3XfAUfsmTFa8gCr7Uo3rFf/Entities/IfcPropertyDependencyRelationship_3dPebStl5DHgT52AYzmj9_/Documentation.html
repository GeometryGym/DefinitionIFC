	 <P>While the <I>IfcPropertyDependencyRelationship</I> may be used to
		describe the dependency, and it may do so in terms of the expression of how the
		dependency operates, it is not possible through the current IFC model for the
		value of the related property to be actually derived from the value of the
		relating property. The determination of value according to the dependency is
		required to be performed by an application that can then use the Expression
		attribute to flag the form of the dependency.</P>
