	 <P><U>Definition from ISO/CD 10303-42</U>:1992: A dimension count is a
		positive integer used to define the coordinate space dimensionality. </P> 
	 <P><U>Definition from IAI</U>: The <I>IfcDimensionCount</I> is restricted
		to have the dimensionality of either 1, 2, or 3 - the WR1 had been added as an
		addition to the STEP P42 entity dimension_count. In contrary to the STEP P42
		constraint, that all geometric representation items within a geometric
		representation context are forced to have the same dimension count, the IFC
		geometry allows mixed dimensions, particularly when defining the boundary of
		planar surfaces. </P>
