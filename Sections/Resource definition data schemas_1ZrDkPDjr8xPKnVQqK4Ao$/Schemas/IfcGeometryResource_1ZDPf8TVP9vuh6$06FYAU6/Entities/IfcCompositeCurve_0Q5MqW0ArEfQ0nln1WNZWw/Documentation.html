	 <P><U>Definition from ISO/CD 10303-42:1992</U>: A composite curve
		(IfcCompositeCurve) is a collection of curves joined end-to-end. The individual
		segments of the curve are themselves defined as composite curve segments. The
		parameterization of the composite curve is an accumulation of the parametric
		ranges of the referenced bounded curves. The first segment is parameterized
		from 0 to <I>l<SUB>1</SUB></I><SUB></SUB>, and, for <I>i</I>
