	 <P><U>Definition from ISO/CD 10303-42:1992</U>: An offset curve 3d is a
		curve at a constant distance from a basis curve in three-dimensional space. The
		underlying curve shall have a well-defined tangent direction at every point. In
		the case of a composite curve the transition code between each segment shall be
		cont same gradient or cont same gradient same curvature. The offset curve at
		any point (parameter) on the basis curve is in the direction <I>V x T</I> where
		<I>V</I> is the fixed reference direction and <I>T</I> is the unit tangent to
		the basis curve. For the offset direction to be well defined, <I>T</I> shall
		not at any point of the curve be in the same, or opposite, direction as
		<I>V</I>.</P>
