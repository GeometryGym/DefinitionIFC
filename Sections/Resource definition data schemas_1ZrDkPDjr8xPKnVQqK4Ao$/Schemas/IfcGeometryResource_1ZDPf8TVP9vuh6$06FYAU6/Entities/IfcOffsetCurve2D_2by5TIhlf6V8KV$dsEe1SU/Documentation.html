	 <P><U>Definition from ISO/CD 10303-42:1992</U>: An offset curve 2d
		(IfcOffsetCurve2d) is a curve at a constant distance from a basis curve in
		two-dimensional space. This entity defines a simple plane-offset curve by
		offsetting by distance along the normal to basis curve in the plane of basis
		curve. The underlying curve shall have a well-defined tangent direction at
		every point. In the case of a composite curve, the transition code between each
		segment shall be cont same gradient or cont same gradient same curvature.</P>

		  self-intersecting. Care should be taken to ensure that the offset to a
		  continuous curve does not become discontinuous.</FONT></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
