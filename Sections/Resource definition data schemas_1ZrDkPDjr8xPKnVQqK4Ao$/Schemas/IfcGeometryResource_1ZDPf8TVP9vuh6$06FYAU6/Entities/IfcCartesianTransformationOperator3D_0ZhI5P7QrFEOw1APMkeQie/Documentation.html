	 <P><U>Definition from ISO/CD 10303-42:1992</U>: A Cartesian transformation
		operator 3d defines a geometric transformation in three-dimensional space
		composed of translation, rotation, mirroring and uniform scaling. The list of
		normalized vectors u defines the columns of an orthogonal matrix <B>T</B>.
		These vectors are computed from the direction attributes axis1, axis2 and axis3
		by the base axis function. If |<B>T</B>|= -1, the transformation includes
		mirroring. </P>
