<p><u>Definition from ISO/CD 10303-42:1992</u>:
The
curve bounded surface is a parametric surface with curved boundaries
defined by one or more boundary curves. The bounded surface is defined
to be the portion of the basis surface in the direction of N x T from
any point on the boundary, where N is the surface normal and T the
boundary curve tangent vector at this point. The region so defined
shall be arcwise connected. </p>
<p><u>Definition from IAI</u>: The <i>IfcCurveBoundedPlane</i>
is a specialized bounded surface class that deals only with bounding
basis plane surfaces. The definition varies from STEP as outer and
inner boundaries are separated attributes and refer to <i>IfcCurve</i>.
The only basis surface that is allowed is of type <i>IfcPlane</i>,
and the implicit_outer attribute has not been incorporated, since only
unbounded surfaces are used as basis surface.</p>
<p>The <i>BasisSurface</i> is an <i>IfcPlane</i>
that establishes the position coordinate system by <i>SELF\IfcElementarySurface.Position</i>.
The <i>OuterBoundary</i> and the <i>InnerBoundaries</i>
(if provided) shall lie on the surface of <i>IfcPlane</i>.
Therefore the <i>IfcCurve</i>'s establishing the outer and
inner boundaries shall be:</p>
<ul> <li>either a 2D curve within the XY plane of the
position
coordinate sytem of <i>IfcPlane</i></li> <li>or
a 3D curve with all coordinates having a z value = 0.</li>
