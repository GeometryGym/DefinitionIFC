	 <P><U>Definition from ISO/CD 10303-42:1992</U>: A placement entity defines
		the local environment for the definition of a geometry item. It locates the
		item to be defined and, in the case of the axis placement subtypes, gives its
		orientation. </P> 
	 <P><U>Additional definition from ISO/WD SC4/WG12/N071 Part42.2
		geometry_schema</U>: A placement locates a geometric item with respect to the
		coordinate system of its geometric context. </P> 
	 <P><U>Definition from IAI</U>: The <I>IfcPlacement</I> is an abstract
		supertype not to be directly instantiated, whereas the STEP P42 entity
		placement can be instantiated to define a placement without orientation. The
		derived attribute <I>Dim</I> has been added, see also note at
		<I>IfcGeometricRepresentationItem</I>. </P>
