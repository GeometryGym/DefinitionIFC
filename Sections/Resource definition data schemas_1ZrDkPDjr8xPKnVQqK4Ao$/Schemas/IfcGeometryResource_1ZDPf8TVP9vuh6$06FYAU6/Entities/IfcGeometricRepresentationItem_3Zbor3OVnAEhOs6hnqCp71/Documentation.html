	 <P><U>Definition from ISO/CD 10303-43:1992</U>: An geometric representation
		item is a representation item that has the additional meaning of having
		geometric position or orientation or both. This meaning is present by virtue
		of: </P> 
	 <UL> 
		<LI>being a Cartesian point or a direction </LI> 
		<LI> referencing directly a Cartesian point or direction </LI> 
		<LI>referencing indirectly a Cartesian point or direction </LI> 
	 </UL> 
	 <P>An indirect reference to a Cartesian point or direction means that a
		given geometric item references the Cartesian point or direction through one or
		more intervening geometry or topology items. </P>

		<P><FONT SIZE="-1">EXAMPLE: Consider a circle. It gains its geometric
		  position and orientation by virtue of a reference to axis2_placement
		  (IfcAxis2Placement) that is turn references a cartesian_point
		  (IfcCartesianPoint) and several directions (IfcDirection). <BR>EXAMPLE:
		  Consider a manifold brep. A manifold_solid_brep (<I>IfcManifoldSolidBrep</I>)
		  is a geometric_representation_item (<I>IfcGeometricRepresentationItem</I>) that
		  through several layers of topological_representation_item's
		  (<I>IfcTopologicalRepresentationItem</I>) references poly loops
		  (<I>IfcPolyLoop</I>). Through additional intervening entities poly loops
		  reference cartesian_point's (<I>IfcCartesianPoint</I>).

	 <P><U>Definition from IAI</U>: The derivation of the dimensionality of the
		<I>IfcGeometricRepresentationItem</I> is different to STEP, there is a specific
		derived attribute at each class that defines the dimensionality, whereas STEP
		does it for the representation_context and requires all
		geometric_representation_item's to have the same dimensionality therein. </P> 
	 <P>The definition of swept area solids as geometric representation items is
		different to STEP, it is based on a set of predefined profiles (or cross
		sections), i.e. a set of parameterized geometric primitives widely supported in
		the industry. Those profiles are used to create volumes through extrusion,
		revolution and cross section based sweep operations. This method was called
		attribute driven geometric representation and it was formerly known as implicit
		geometry in IFC. </P>
