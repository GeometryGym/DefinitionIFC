	 <P><U>Definition from ISO/CD 10303-42:1992</U>: A point defined by its
		coordinates in a two or three dimensional rectangular Cartesian coordinate
		system, or in a two dimensional parameter space. The entity is defined in a two
		or three dimensional space. </P> 
	 <P><U>Definition from IAI</U>: The derived attribute <I>Dim</I> has been
		added (see also note at <I>IfcGeometricRepresentationItem</I>). The WR1 was
		added to constrain the usage of <I>IfcCartesianPoint</I> in the context of IFC
		geometry. For the purpose of defining geometry in IFC only two and three
		dimensional Cartesian points are used. </P>
