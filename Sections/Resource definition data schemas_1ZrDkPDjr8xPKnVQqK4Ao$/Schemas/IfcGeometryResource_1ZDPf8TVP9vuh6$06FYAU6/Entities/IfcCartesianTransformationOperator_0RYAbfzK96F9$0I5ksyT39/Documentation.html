	 <P><U>Definition from ISO/CD 10303-42:1992</U>: A Cartesian transformation
		operator defines a geometric transformation composed of translation, rotation,
		mirroring and uniform scaling. The list of normalized vectors u defines the
		columns of an orthogonal matrix T. These vectors are computed, by the base axis
		function, from the direction attributes axis1, axis2 and, in Cartesian
		transformation operator 3d, axis3. If <B>|T|= -1</B>, the transformation
		includes mirroring. The local origin point <B>A</B>, the scale value
		<B><I>S</I></B> and the matrix <B>T</B> together define a transformation. </P> 
	 <P>The transformation for a point with position vector P is defined by </P>

	 <P> For those entities whose attributes include an axis2 placement, the
		transformation is applied, after the derivation, to the derived attributes p
		defining the placement coordinate directions. For a transformed surface, the
		direction of the surface normal at any point is obtained by transforming the
		normal, at the corresponding point, to the original surface. For geometric
		entities with attributes (such as the radius of a circle) which have the
		dimensionality of length, the values will be multiplied by <I>S</I>. </P> 
	 <P>For curves on surface the p curve.reference to curve will be unaffected
		by any transformation. The Cartesian transformation operator shall only be
		applied to geometry defined in a consistent system of units with the same units
		on each axis. With all optional attributes omitted, the transformation defaults
		to the identity transformation. The Cartesian transformation operator shall
		only be instantiated as one of its subtypes. </P>
