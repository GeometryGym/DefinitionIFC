	 <P><U>Definition from IAI</U>: An <I>Ifc2DCompositeCurve</I> is an
		<I>IfcCompositeCurve</I> that is defined within the coordinate space of an
		<I>IfcPlane</I>. Therefore the dimensionality of the <I>Ifc2DCompositeCurve</I>
		has to be 2. </P>

		  enhancement of the profile definition capacities in IFC Release 2.x this entity
		  is not needed anymore for the definition of boundaries on a plane. Therefore
		  this entity is marked as deprecated - that means it will not be supported in
		  future versions of IFC.</FONT></P></BLOCKQUOTE>

		<P><FONT COLOR="#0000FF" SIZE="-1">NOTE: This entity has been introduced
		  to get a more straight forward definition of surface boundaries than by its
		  counterpart in STEP: composite_curve_on_surface and boundary_curve. Since the
		  only basis elementary surface in IFC is the plane surface, a two dimensional
		  composite curve provides enough capability to define the boundary. </FONT></P>
