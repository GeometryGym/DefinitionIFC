	 <P><U>Definition from ISO/CD 10303-42:1992</U>: The location and
		orientation in two dimensional space of two mutually perpendicular axes. An
		axis2_placement_2d is defined in terms of a point, (inherited from the
		placement supertype), and an axis. It can be used to locate and originate an
		object in two dimensional space and to define a placement coordinate system.
		The class includes a point which forms the origin of the placement coordinate
		system. A direction vector is required to complete the definition of the
		placement coordinate system. The reference direction defines the placement X
		axis direction, the placement Y axis is derived from this. </P> 
	 <P><U>Definition from IAI</U>: If the <I>RefDirection</I> attribute is not
		given, the placement defaults to P[1] (x-axis) as [1.,0.] and P[2] (y-axis) as
		[0.,1.]. </P>
