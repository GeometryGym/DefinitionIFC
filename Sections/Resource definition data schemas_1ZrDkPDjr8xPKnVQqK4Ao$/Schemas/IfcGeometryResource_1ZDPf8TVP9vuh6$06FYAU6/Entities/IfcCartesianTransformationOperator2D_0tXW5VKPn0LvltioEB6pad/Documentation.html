	 <P><U>Definition from ISO/CD 10303-42:1992</U>: A Cartesian transformation
		operator 2d defines a geometric transformation in two-dimensional space
		composed of translation, rotation, mirroring and uniform scaling. The list of
		normalized vectors u defines the columns of an orthogonal matrix <B>T</B>.
		These vectors are computed from the direction attributes axis1 and axis2 by the
		base axis function. If <B>|T|= -1</B>, the transformation includes mirroring.
