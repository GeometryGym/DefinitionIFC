	 <P><U>Definition from ISO/CD 10303-42:1992</U>: A composite curve segment
		(IfcCompositeCurveSegment) is a bounded curve together with transition
		information which is used to construct a composite curve (IfcCompositeCurve).
		</P>
	 <P> <U>Definition from IAI</U>: The derived attribute Dim has been added
		(see also note at IfcGeometricRepresentationItem). The IfcCompositeCurveSegment
		is a subtype of IfcGeometricRepresentationItem (whereas in STEP P42
		composite_curve_segment is not a subtype of geometric_representation_item, the
		proposed 2nd edition of P42 however proposes the subtype relationship). </P>
