		terms of the direction and magnitude of the vector. The value of the magnitude
		attribute defines the magnitude of the vector.</P>

		<P><FONT SIZE="-1">NOTE: The magnitude of the vector can not be reliable
		  calculated from the components of the Orientation attribute. This form of
		  representation was selected to reduce problems with numerical instability. For
		  example a vector of magnitude 2.0 mm and equally inclined to the coordinate
		  axes could be represented with Orientation attribute of (1.0,1.0,1.0).
