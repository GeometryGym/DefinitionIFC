<p><u>Definition
from ISO/CD 10303-43:1992</u>: A
mapped item is the use of an existing representation (the mapping
source - mapped representation) as a representation item in a second
representation. </p>
<blockquote>
  <p><font
 size="-1">NOTE: A mapped item is a subtype of
representation item. It enables a representation to be used as a
representation item in one or more other representations. The mapped
item allows for the definition of a representation using other
representations. </font></p>
</blockquote>
<p><u>Definition
from IAI</u>: The <i>IfcMappedItem</i>
is the inserted instance of a source definition (to be compared with a
block / shared cell / macro definition). The instance is inserted by
applying
a Cartesian transformation operator as the <i>MappingTarget</i>.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><font
 size="-1">EXAMPLE&nbsp; An <i>IfcMappedItem</i>
can reuse other
mapped items (ako nested blocks), doing so the <i>IfcRepresentationMap</i>
is based on an <i>IfcShapeRepresentation</i>
including one or more <i>IfcMappedItem</i>'s.<br>

Propositions</u></p>
<ol>
  <li>A mapped item shall not be
self-defining by participating in the definition of the representation
being mapped.</li>
  <li>The dimensionality of the
mapping source and the mapping target has to be the same, if the
mapping source is a geometric representation item.</li>
