	 <P><B>Space Dimensionality</B><BR>All geometry shall be defined in a
		right-handed rectangular Cartesian coordinate system with the same units on
		each axis. A common scheme has been used for the definition of both
		two-dimensional and three-dimensional geometry. Points and directions exists in
		both a two-dimensional and a three-dimensional form, these forms are
		distinguished solely by the presence, or absence, of a third coordinate value.
		Complex geometric entities are all defined using points and directions from
		which their space dimensionality can be deduced.</P>
	 <P><B>Parameterization of analytic curves and surfaces</B><BR>Each curve on
		surface specified here has a defined parameterization. In some instances the
		definitions are in parametric terms. In others, the conic curves and elementary
		surfaces, the definitions are in geometric terms. In this latter case a
		placement coordinate system is used to define the parameterization. The
		geometric definitions contain some, but not all, of the data required for this.
		The relevant data to define this placement coordinate system is contained in
		the axis2_placement (IfcAxis2Placement) associated with the individual curve
		and surface entities. </P> 
	 <P><B>Curves</B><BR>The curve entities include lines, some elementary
		conics, and some referentially or procedurally defined curves. All the curves
		have a well defined parameterization which makes it possible to trim a curve or
		identify points on the curve by parameter value. For the conic curves a method
		of representation is used which separates their geometric form from their
		orientation and position in space. In each case, the position and orientation
		information is conveyed by an axis2_placement (IfcAxis2Placement). A composite
		curve entity, which includes the facility to communicate continuity information
		at the curve-to-curve transition points, is provided for the construction of
		more complex curves. The offset curve type is a curve defined with reference to
		other geometry. Separate offset curves entities exist for 2D and 3D
		applications.</P>
	 <P><B>Surfaces</B><BR>The simple surfaces are the planar surface, a surface
		of revolution and a surface of linear extrusion. As with curves, all surfaces
		have an associated standard parameterization. In many cases the surfaces, as
		defined, are unbounded; it is assumed that they will be bounded either
		explicitly or implicitly. Explicit bounding is achieved with the bounded
		surface (here: plane); implicit bounding requires the association of additional
		topological information to define a face.</P>
