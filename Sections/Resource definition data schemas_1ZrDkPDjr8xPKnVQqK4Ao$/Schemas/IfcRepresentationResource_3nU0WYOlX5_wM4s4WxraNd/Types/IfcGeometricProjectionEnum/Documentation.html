<p><u>Definition
from IAI</u>: The <i>IfcGeometricProjectionEnum</i>
defines the various representation types that can be semantically
distinguished. Often different levels of detail of the shape
representation are controlled by the representation type.<br>
</p>
<ul>
  <li><b>GRAPH_VIEW</b>:
Geometric display representation that shows an abstract, often 1D
element representation, e.g. representing a wall by its axis line.</li>
  <li><b>SKETCH_VIEW</b>:
Geometric display representation that shows an abstract, often 2D
element representation, e.g. representing a wall by its two foot print
edges, surpressing any inner layer representation.</li>
  <li><b>MODEL_VIEW</b>:
Geometric display representation that shows a full 3D element
representation, e.g. representing a wall by its volumetric body.</li>
  <li><b>PLAN_VIEW</b>:
Geometric display representation that shows a full 2D element
representation, the level of detail often depends on the target scale,
e.g. representing a wall by its two foot print edges and the edges of
all inner layers. The projection is shown in ground view as seen from
above.</li>
  <li><b>REFLECTED_PLAN_VIEW</b>:
Geometric display representation that shows a full 2D element
representation, the level of detail often depends on the target scale,
e.g. representing a wall by its two foot print edges and the edges of
all inner layers. The projection is shown in ground view as seen from
below.</li>
  <li><b>SECTION_VIEW</b>:
Geometric display representation that shows a full 2D element
representation, the level of detail often depends on the target scale,
e.g. representing a wall by its two inner/outer edges and the edges of
all inner layers, if the element is cut by the section line.</li>
  <li><b>ELEVATION_VIEW</b>:
Geometric display representation that shows a full 2D element
representation, the level of detail often depends on the target scale,
e.g. representing a wall by its bounding edges if the element is within
an elevation view.</li>
  <li><b>USERDEFINED</b>:
A user defined specification is given by the value of the <i>UserDefinedTargetView</i>
attribute.</li>
  <li><b>NOTDEFINED</b>:
No specification given.</li>
