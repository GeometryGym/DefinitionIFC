	 <P><I>Definition of the IAI</I>: This schema defines the representation of
		shape and topology as important definitional properties for products defined
		within the IFC Object Model. The representations characterize certain
		properties of a product, and any product can be defined by zero, one, or many
		of those properties. The schema defines two ways to represent definitional
		properties of products:</P>
	 <UL>
		<LI>topological representation </LI>
		<LI> geometric shape representation </LI>
	 </UL>
	 <P> The geometric shape representation allows for </P>
	 <UL>
		<LI>multiple shape representations for the same product definition shape
		  of a product </LI>
		<LI>separate shape representations for components or parts of the product
		  definition shape by using shape aspects </LI>
	 </UL>
	 <P>The following parts of ISO10303, STEP, had been reviewed to provide
		input into the specification of the representation resource for the IFC Object
		Model: </P>
	 <UL>
		<LI><I>Part 41</I>, Integrated Generic Resources &#150; Fundamental of
		  Product Description and Support product_property_definition_schema
		  product_property_representation_schema </LI>
		<LI><I>Part 42</I>, Integrated Generic Resources &#150; Geometric and
		  Topological Representation geometry_schema </LI>
		<LI><I>Part 43</I>, Integrated Generic Resources &#150; Representation
		  Structures representation_schema </LI>
	 </UL>
	 <P>Please note, that the above listed resources which are defined within
		Integrated Resources of STEP had been interpreted to fit into the IFC
		architecture.</P>
