<p><u>Definition from IAI</u>: The <i>IfcShapeModel</i>
represents the concept of a particular geometric and/or topological
representation of a
product's shape or a product component's shape within a representation
context. This
representation context has to be a geometric
representation context (with the exception of topology representations
without associated geometry). The two subtypes are <i>IfcShapeRepresentation</i>
to cover the geometric models (or sets) that represent a shape, and <i>IfcTopologyRepresentation</i>
to cover the conectivity of a product or product component. The
topology may or may not have geometry associated.</p>
The <i>IfcShapeModel</i> can be a shape representation
(geometric and/or topologogical) of a product (via <i>IfcProductDefinitionShape</i>),
or a shape representation (geometric and/or topologogical) &nbsp;of
a component of a product shape (via <i>IfcShapeAspect</i>).<br>
