<p><u>Definition
from IAI</u>: The <i>IfcGeometricRepresentationSubContext</i>
defines the context that applies to several shape representations of a
product being a sub context, sharing the <i>WorldCoordinateSystem</i>,
<i>CoordinateSpaceDimension</i>, <i>Precision</i> and <i>TrueNorth</i>
attributes with the parent <i>IfcGeometricRepresentationContext</i>.</p>
<p>The <i>IfcGeometricRepresentationSubContext</i>
is used to define semantically distinguished representation types for
different information content, dependent on the representation view and
the target scale. It can be used to control the level of detail of the
shape representation that is most applicable to this geometric
representation context. addition the sub context is used to
control the later appearance of the <i>IfcShapeRepresentation
</i>within a plot view. <br>
</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><small>NOTE&nbsp;
If the <i>IfcShapeRepresentation</i>
using this sub context has<i>
IfcStyledItem</i>'s assigned to the <i>Items</i>,
the presentation style information (e.g. <i>IfcCurveStyle</i>,
  <i>IfcTextStyle</i>)
associated with the <i>IfcStyledItem</i>
is given in target
plot dimensions. E.g. a line thickness (<i>IfcCurveStyle.CurveWidth</i>)
is given by a thickness measure relating to the thickness for a plot
within the (range of) target scale.</small></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Each <i>IfcProduct</i>
can then have several instances of subtypes of <i>IfcRepresentation</i>,
each being assigned to a different geometric representation context (<i>IfcGeometricRepresentationContext</i>
or <i>IfcGeometricRepresentationSubContext</i>).
The application can then choose the most appropriate representation for
showing the geometric shape of the product, depending on the target
view and scale.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><small>NOTE
The provision of a model view
(<i>IfcGeometricRepresentationContext.ContextType</i>
= 'Model') is mandatory. Instances of <i>IfcGeometricRepresentationSubContext</i>
relate to it as its <i>ParentContext</i>.</small></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
  <p><small>EXAMPLE&nbsp;
Instances
of <i>IfcGeometricRepresentationSubContext</i>
can be used to handle the multi-view blocks or macros,
which are used
in CAD programs to store several scale and/or view dependent geometric
representations of the same object.</small>
