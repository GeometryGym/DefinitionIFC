	 <P><U>Definition from IAI</U>: An <I>IfcConstraint</I> is used to define a
		constraint or limiting value or boundary condition that may be applied to an
		object or to the value of a property. </P>

	 <P> <I>IfcConstraint</I> may be associated with any subtype of
		<I>IfcObject</I> through the <I>IfcRelAssociatesConstraint</I> relationship in
		the <I>IfcControlExtension</I> schema.</P> 
	 <P>A constraint may aggregate other constraints through the
		<I>IfcConstraintAggregationRelationship</I> through which a logical association
		between constraints may be applied.</P> 
	 <P>A constraint must have a name applied through the
		<I>IfcConstraint.Name</I> attribute and optionally, a description through
		<I>IfcConstraint.Description</I>. For instance, when undertaking a move
		(instantiated through the <I>IfcMove</I> class), a constraint may be named as a
		'Move Start Constraint' or 'Move End Constraint' and described using one of a
		possible range of move constraints as shown in the table below. </P> 
	 <P><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Application of constraints to moves as indicated
		by this example replaces the use of IfcActionTimeControl class which is now
		deleted.</FONT></P>

	 <P>The constraint is instantiated as the class <I>IfcMetric</I> and uses a
		Date/Time value through <I>IfcMetricValue</I>. An appropriate benchmark is
		applied according to the requirement of the constraint (as indicated). The
		grade of the constraint (hard, soft, advisory) must be specified through
		<I>IfcConstraint.ConstraintGrade</I> whilst the time at which the constraint is
		created may be optionally asserted through
		<I>IfcConstraint.ConstraintTime</I>.</P>
