	 <P>The <I>IfcConstraintAggregationRelationship</I> allows the aggregation
		link between constraints to be logically defined (AND, OR). In this way, where
		an object or property has multiple constraints assigned, the linkage between
		them can be specified. Thus linked constraints might show as (&gt; X AND &lt;
		Y) which is useful for an allowed range or bounded value or as (A OR B OR C)
		which is valuable for an enumerated property where a selection is constrained
		to be one of A, B or C. </P>
