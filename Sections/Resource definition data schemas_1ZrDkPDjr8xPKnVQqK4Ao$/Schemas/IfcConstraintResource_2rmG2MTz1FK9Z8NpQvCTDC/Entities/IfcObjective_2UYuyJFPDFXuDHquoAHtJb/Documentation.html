	 <H3>Use Definition</H3> 
	 <P><I>IfcObjective</I> is a subtype of <I>IfcConstraint</I> and may be
		associated with any subtype of IfcObject through the
		<I>IfcRelAssociatesConstraint</I> relationship in the
		<I>IfcControlExtension</I> schema.</P>
	 <P>The aim of <I>IfcObjective</I> is to specify the purpose for which the
		constraint is applied and to capture the values of the constraint. These may be
		both the benchmark values that are intended to indicate the constraint extent
		and the resulting values in use that enable performance comparisons to be
		applied.</P>
