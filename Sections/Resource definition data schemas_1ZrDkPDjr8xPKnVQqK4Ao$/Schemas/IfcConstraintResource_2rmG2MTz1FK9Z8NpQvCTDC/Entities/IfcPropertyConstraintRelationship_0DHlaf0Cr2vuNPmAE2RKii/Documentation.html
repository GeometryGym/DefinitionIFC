	 <P>An <I>IfcPropertyConstraintRelationship</I> allows for the specification
		of a constraint to be applied to many properties. The constraints applied
		therefore enable a property to carry values identifying requirements as well as
		those identifying the fulfilment of those requirements.</P> 
	 <P>The example below shows how a constraint may be applied to a property
		within a property set. For simplicity, only the mandatory attributes are shown
		as asserted. It shows how a property 'ThingWeight' which has a nominal value of
		19.5 kg has two constraints that are logically aggregated by an AND connection.
		One of the constraints has a benchmark of 'GREATERTHANOREQUALTO' whilst the
		second has a benchmark of 'LESSTHANOREQUALTO'. This means that the constraint
		must lie between these two bounding values. The relating constraint is
		instantiated as an objective named as 'Weight Constraint' and qualified as a
		SPECIFICATION constraint. The two related constraints are both specified as
		metrics since they can have specific values.</P>
