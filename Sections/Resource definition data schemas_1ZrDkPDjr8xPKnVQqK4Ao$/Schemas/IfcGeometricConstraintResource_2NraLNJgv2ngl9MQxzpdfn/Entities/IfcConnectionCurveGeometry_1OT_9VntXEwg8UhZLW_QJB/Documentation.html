<EPM-HTML> 
<p><u>Definition from IAI</u>: The <i>IfcConnectionCurveGeometry</i>
is used to describe the geometric constraints that facilitate the
physical connection of two objects at a curve&nbsp;<font
 color="#0000ff">or at an edge with curve geometry associated</font>.
It is envisioned as a control that applies to the element connection
relationships. </p>
<blockquote><small>
EXAMPLE&nbsp; The
connection relationship between two walls has a geometric constraint
which describes the end caps (or cut-off of the wall ends) by a <i>CurveOnRelatingElement</i>
for the first wall and a <i>CurveOnRelatedElement</i> for
the second wall. The exact usage of the <i>IfcConnectionCurveGeometry</i>
is further defined in the geometry use sections of the elements that
use it.</small>
</blockquote>
<p>The available geometry for the connection constraint may be
further restricted to only allow straight segments by applying <i>IfcPolyline</i>
only. Such an usage constraint is provided at the object definition of
the <i>IfcElement</i> subtype, utilizing the element
connection by referring to the subtype of <i>IfcRelConnects</i>
with the associated&nbsp;<i>IfcConnectionCurveGeometry.</i></p>

<p><b><u>Geometry Use Definitions</u>:</b></p>
<p>The <i>IfcCurve</i> (or the <i>IfcEdgeCurve</i>
with an associated <i>IfcCurve</i>) at the <i>CurveOnRelatingElement</i>
attribute defines the curve where the basic geometry items of the
connected elements connects. The curve geometry and coordinates are
provided within
the local coordinate system of the <i>RelatingElement</i>,
as specified at the <i>IfcRelConnects </i>Subtype that
utilizes the <i>IfcConnectionCurveGeometry</i>.
Optionally, the same curve geometry and coordinates can also be
provided within the
local coordinate system of the <i>RelatedElement</i> by
using the <i>CurveOnRelatedElement</i> attribute. </p>
