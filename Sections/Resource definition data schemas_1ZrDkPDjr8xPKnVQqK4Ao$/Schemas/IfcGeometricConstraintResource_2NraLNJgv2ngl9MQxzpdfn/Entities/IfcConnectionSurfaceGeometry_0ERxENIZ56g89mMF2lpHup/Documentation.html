<p><u>Definition from IAI</u>: The <i>IfcConnectionSurfaceGeometry</i>
is used to describe the geometric constraints that facilitate the
physical connection of two objects at a surface&nbsp;<font
 color="#0000ff">or at a face with surface geometry associated</font>.
It is envisioned as a control that applies to the element connection
relationships. </p>

<p><b><u>Geometry Use Definitions</u>:</b></p>
<p> The <i>IfcSurface</i> (or the <i>IfcFaceSurface</i>
with an associated <i>IfcSurface</i>) at the <i>SurfaceOnRelatingElement</i>
attribute defines the surface where the basic geometry items of the
connected elements connects. The surface geometry and coordinates are
provided within
the local coordinate system of the <i>RelatingElement</i>,
as specified at the <i>IfcRelConnectsSubtype</i> that
utilizes the <i>IfcConnectionSurfaceGeometry</i>.
Optionally, the same&nbsp;surface geometry and coordinates can also
be provided within the
local coordinate system of the <i>RelatedElement</i> by
using the <i>SurfaceOnRelatedElement</i> attribute.</p>
