<p><u>Definition from IAI</u>: The <i>IfcConnectionPointGeometry</i>
is used to describe the geometric constraints that facilitate the
physical connection of two objects at a point (here <i>IfcCartesianPoint</i>)
<font color="#0000ff">or at an vertex with point
coordinates associated</font>. It is envisioned as a control that
applies to the element connection relationships. </p>
<blockquote><small>
EXAMPLE&nbsp; The
connection relationship between two path based elements (like a column
and a beam) has a geometric constraint which describes the connection
points by a <i>PointOnRelatingElement</i> for the column
and a <i>PointOnRelatedElement</i> for the beam. The exact
usage of the <i>IfcConnectionPointGeometry</i> is further
defined in the geometry use sections of the elements that use it.<br>
  <br>
NOTE &nbsp;If the point
connection has an offset, i.e. if the two points (or vertex points) at
the relating and related element do not physically match, the subtype
IfcConnectionPointEccentricity shall be used.</small>

New entity in IFC Release 1.5, has been renamed from
IfcPointConnectionGeometry in IFC Release 2x.</font> <br>

The provision of topology with associated geometry, <i>IfcVertexPoint</i>, is

<p><b><u>Geometry Use Definitions</u>: </b></p>
<p>The <i>IfcPoint</i> (or the <i>IfcVertexPoint</i>
with an associated <i>IfcPoint</i>) at the <i>PointOnRelatingElement</i>
attribute defines the point where the basic geometry items of the
connected elements connects. The point coordinates are provided within
the local coordinate system of the <i>RelatingElement</i>,
as specified at the <i>IfcRelConnectsSubtype</i> that
utilizes the <i>IfcConnectionPointGeometry</i>.
Optionally, the same point coordinates can also be provided within the
local coordinate system of the <i>RelatedElement</i> by
using the <i>PointOnRelatedElement</i> attribute. If both
point coordinates are not identical within a common parent coordinate
system (latestly within the world coordinate system), the subtype <i>IfcConnectionPointEccentricity</i>
shall be used. </p>
