<p><u>Definition from IFC</u>: The <i>IfcLocalPlacement</i>
defines the relative placement of a product in relation to the
placement of another product or the absolute placement of a product
within the geometric representation context of the project. </p>
<p>The <i>IfcLocalPlacement</i> allows that an <i>IfcProduct</i>
can be placed by this <i>IfcLocalPlacement</i> (through
the attribute<i>ObjectPlacement</i>) within the local
coordinate system of the object placement of another <i>IfcProduct</i>,
which is referenced by the <i>PlacementRelTo</i>. Rules to
prevent cyclic relative placements have to be introduced on the
application level.</p>
<p>If the <i>PlacementRelTo</i> is not given, then
the <i>IfcProduct</i> is placed absolutely within the
world coordinate system.</p>

<p><b><u>Geometry use definitions</u>:</b></p>
<p>The following conventions shall apply as default relative
positions if the relative placement is used. The conventions are given
for all five direct subtypes of <i>IfcProduct</i>, the <i>IfcSpatialStructureElement</i>,
<i>IfcElement</i>, <i>IfcAnnotation</i>, <i>IfcGrid</i>,
<i>IfcPort</i>. More detailed placement information is
given at the level of subtypes of those five types mentioned.</p>
<ul>
  <li>For the subtypes of <i>IfcSpatialStructureElement</i>
the following conventions apply
    <ul>
      <li><i>IfcSite</i> shall be placed absolutely
within the world coordinate system established by the geometric
representation context of the <i>IfcProject</i> </li>
      <li><i>IfcBuilding</i> shall be placed relative
to the local placement of <i>IfcSite</i> </li>
      <li><i>IfcBuildingStorey</i> shall be placed
relative to the local placement of <i>IfcBuilding</i> </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>For <i>IfcGrid</i> and <i>IfcAnnotation</i>
the convention applies that it shall be placed relative
    <ul>
      <li> to the local placement of its container (<i>IfcSite,
IfcBuilding, IfcBuildingStorey</i>)
        <ul>
          <li>it should be the same container element that is
referenced by the <i>IfcRelContainedInSpatialStructure</i>
containment relationship,</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>For <i>IfcPort</i> the convention applies that
it shall be placed relative
    <ul>
      <li> to the local placement of the element it belongs to (<i>IfcElement</i>)
        <ul>
          <li>it should be the same element that is referenced by
the <i>IfcRelConnectsPortToElement</i> connection
relationship,</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li> For <i>IfcElement</i> the convention applies
that it shall be placed relative:
    <ul>
      <li> to the local placement of its container (<i>IfcSite,
IfcBuilding, IfcBuildingStorey</i>)
        <ul>
          <li>it should be the same container element that is
referenced by the <i>IfcRelContainedInSpatialStructure</i>
containment relationship,</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>to the local placement of the <i>IfcElement</i>
to which it is tied by an element composition relationship
        <ul>
          <li>for features that are located relative to the main
component (such as openings), as expressed by <i>IfcRelVoidsElement</i>
and<i> IfcRelProjectsElement</i>,</li>
          <li>for elements that fill an opening (such as doors or
windows), as expressed by<i>IfcRelFillsElement</i>,</li>
          <li>for coverings that cover the element, as expressed
by<i>IfcRelCoversBldgElements,</i></li>
          <li>for sub components that are aggregated to the main
component, as expressed by <i> IIfcRelAggregates</i> and <i>IfcRelNests</i>)</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>If the <i>PlacementRelTo</i> relationship is not
given, then it defaults to an absolute placement within the world
coordinate system established by the referenced geometric
representation context within the project. </p>
