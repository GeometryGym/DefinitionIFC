<p><u>Definition from IAI</u>: Abstract supertype for
the special types defining the object coordinate system. The <i>IfcObjectPlacement</i>
has to be provided for each product that has a shape representation.</p>
<p>The object placement can be given:</p>
<ul>
  <li>absolute, i.e. by an axis2 placement, relative to the world
coordinate system,</li>
  <li>relative, i.e. by an axis2 placement, relative to the
object placement of another product,</li>
  <li>by grid reference, i.e. by the virtual intersection and
reference direction given by two axes of a design grid.</li>
</ul>
<p>In any case the object placement has to unambiguously define
the object coordinate system as either two-dimensional axis placement (<i>IfcAxis2Placement2D</i>)
or three-dimensional axis placement (<i>IfcAxis2Placement3D</i>).
The axis placement may have to be calculated.</p>
<p>Informal proposition</p>
<ol>
  <li>No two or more elements (subtypes of <i>IfcProduct</i>)
shall share the same instance of <i>IfcObjectPlacement</i>.&nbsp;</li>
</ol>
