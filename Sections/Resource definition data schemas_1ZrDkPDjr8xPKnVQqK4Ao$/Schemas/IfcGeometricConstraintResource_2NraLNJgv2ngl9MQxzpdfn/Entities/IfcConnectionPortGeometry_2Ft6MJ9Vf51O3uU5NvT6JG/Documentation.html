<p><u>Definition from IAI</u>: The <i>IfcConnectionPortGeometry</i>
is used to describe the geometric constraints that facilitate the
physical connection of two objects at a port having a profile geometry
(here <i>IfcProfile</i>). It is envisioned as a control
that applies to the element connection relationships. </p>
<p>This entity defines the geometric location and configuration
of a port on a distribution element. This information can be used to
determine how to physically connect distribution elements. </p>
