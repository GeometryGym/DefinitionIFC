<p><u>Definition from IAI</u>: An individual axis,
the <i>IfcGridAxis</i>, is defined in the context of a
design grid. The axis definition is based on a curve of dimensionality
2. The grid axis is positioned within the XY plane of the position
coordinate system defined by the <i>IfcDesignGrid</i>.</p>

<p><b><u>Geometry Use Definitions</u>: </b></p>
<p>The standard geometric representation of <i>IfcGridAxis</i>
is defined using a 2D curve entity. Grid axes are normally defined by
an offset to another axis. The <i>IfcOffsetCurve2D</i>
supports this concept.</p>
<p>Each grid axis has a sense given by the parameterization of
the curve. The attribute <i>SameSense</i> is an indicator
of whether or not the sense of the grid axis agrees with, or opposes,
that of the underlying curve. </p>
