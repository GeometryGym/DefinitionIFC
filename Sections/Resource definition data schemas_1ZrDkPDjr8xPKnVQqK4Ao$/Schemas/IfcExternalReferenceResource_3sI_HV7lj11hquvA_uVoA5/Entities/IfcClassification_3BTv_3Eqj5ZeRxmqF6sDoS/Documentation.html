	 <P><I>IfcClassification</I> identifies the classification system or source
		from which a classification notation is derived. The objective is to minimize
		the number of <I>IfcClassification</I> objects contained within an IFC model.
		Ideally, each classification system or source used should have only one
		<I>IfcClassification</I> object. However, because multiple classification is
		allowed, there may be many <I>IfcClassification</I> objects used, each
		identifying a different classification system or source.</P>
