	 <P><U>Definition from IAI</U>: An <I>IfcClassificationItemRelationship</I>
		is a relationship class that enables the hierarchical structure of a
		classification system to be exposed through its ability to contain related
		classification items and to be contained by a relating classification item.</P>

	 <P><I>IfcClassificationItem</I>'s can be progressively decomposed using the
		<I>IfcClassificationItemRelationship</I> such that the relationship always
		captures the information about the parent level (relating) item and the child
		level (related) items of which there can be many. The following example shows
		how this could be achieved for the Uniclass system.</P>

	 <P>The inverse relationships from <I>IfcClassificationItem</I> to
		<I>IfcClassificationRelationship</I> enable information about the relationship
		to be recovered by the items concerned so that they are also aware of the
		decomposition. The cardinality of the inverse relationship is that an
		<I>IfcClassificationItem</I> can be the classifying item in only one
		relationship and can be a classified item in only one relationship. This
		implies that there is no overlap of <I>IfcClassificationItem's</I>. This
		reflects typical classification approaches which use strict hierarchical
		decomposition (or taxonomy) and do not have matrix relationships.</P>
