	 <P><U>Definition from IAI</U>: An <I>IfcExternalReference</I> is the
		identification of information that is not explicitly represented in the current
		model or in the project database (as an implementation of the current model).
		Such information may be contained in classifications, documents or libraries.
		</P>
	 <P>Only the <I>Location</I> (e.g. as an URL) is given to describe the place
		where the information can be found. Also an optional <I>ItemReference</I> as a
		key to allow more specific references (as to sections or tables) is provided.
		The <I>ItemReference</I> defines a system interpretable method to identify the
		relevant part of information at the data source (given by <I>Location</I>). In
		addition a human interpretable <I>Name</I> can be assigned to identify the
		information subject (e.g. classification code).</P>
	 <P><I>IfcExternalReference</I> is an abstract supertype of all external
		reference classes.</P>
