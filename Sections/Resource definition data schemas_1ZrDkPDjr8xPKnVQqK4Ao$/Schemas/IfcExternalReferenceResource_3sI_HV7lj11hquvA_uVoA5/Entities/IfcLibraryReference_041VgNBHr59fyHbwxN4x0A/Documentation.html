	 <P><U>Definition from IAI</U>: An <I>IfcLibraryReference</I> is a reference
		into a library of information by location (as an URL). It also provides an
		optional inherited <I>ItemReference</I> key to allow more specific references
		to library sections or tables, and the inherited <I>Name</I> attribute allows
		for a human interpretable identification of the library item. Also, general
		information on the external library can be given through
		<I>IfcLibraryInformation</I>, accessed by ReferenceIntoLibrary.</P>
