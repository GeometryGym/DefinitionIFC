	 <P><U>Definition from IAI</U>: An <I>IfcDocumentReference</I> is a
		reference to the location of a document. The reference is given by a system
		interpretable <I>Location</I> attribute (e.g., an URL string) or by a human
		readable location, where the document can be found, and an optional inherited
		internal reference <I>ItemReference</I>, which refers to a system interpretable
		position within the document. The optional inherited <I>Name</I> attribute is
		meant to have meaning for human readers. Optional document metadata can also be
		captured through reference to <I>IfcDocumentInformation</I>.</P>

	 <P>Provides a lightweight capability that enables a document to be
		identified solely by reference to a name by which it is commonly known. The
		reference can also be used to point to document information for more detail as
		required.</P> 
	 <P>For example, the IAI mission statement in a document "Introduction to
		IAI" can be referenced by <I>IfcDocumentReference.Location</I> =
		'http://iai-international.org/intro.html', and IfcDocumentReference = 'Mission
		statement'. Additionally:
		<I>IfcDocumentReference.ReferenceToDocument[1].Name</I> = 'Introduction to
		IAI', and <I>IfcDocumentReference.ReferenceToDocument[1].Description</I> =
		'Basic document to introduce the aims of IAI'.</P>
