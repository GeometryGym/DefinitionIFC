	 <P><U>Definition from IAI: </U>An <I>IfcClassificationReference</I> is a
		reference into a classification system or source (see
		<I>IfcClassification</I>). An optional inherited <I>ItemReference</I> key is
		also provided to allow more specific references to classification items (or
		tables) by type. The inherited <I>Name</I> attribute allows for a human
		interpretable designation of a classification notation (or code) - see use
		definition of "Lightweight Classification".</P>

	 <H4>Lightweight Classification</H4> 
	 <P>The <I>IfcClassificationReference</I> can be used as a form of
		'lightweight' classification through the '<I>ItemReference</I>' attribute
		inherited from the abstract <I>IfcExternalReference</I> class. In this case,
		the '<I>ItemReference</I>' could take (for instance) the Uniclass notation
		"L6814" which, if the classification was well understood by all parties and was
		known to be taken from a particular classification source, would be sufficient.
		The <I>Name</I> attribute could be the title "Tanking". This would remove the
		need for the overhead of the more complete classification structure of the
		model.</P> 
	 <P>However, it is not recommended that this lightweight method be used in
		cases where more than one classification system is in use or where there may be
		uncertainty as to the origin or meaning of the classification.</P> 
	 <H4>Referencing from an External Source</H4> 
	 <P>Classifications of an object may be referenced from an external source
		rather than being contained within the IFC model. This is done through the
		<I>IfcClassificationReference</I> class.</P>
