	 <P><U>Definition from IAI: </U>An <I>IfcClassificationNotation</I> is a
		notation used from published reference (which may be either publicly available
		from a classification society or is published locally for the purposes of an
		organization, project or other purpose). </P>

	 <P>A classification notation may be developed using various notation
		facets. A facet is a part of the actual notation but which has a specific
		meaning. For instance, it may be appropriate to classify an item by owning
		actor (represented by A=Architect) and by an entry from a classification table
		such as CI/SfB (represented by 210 for external wall). This gives a
		classification as A210.</P> 
	 <P>All classifications of an object that are contained within the IFC model
		are made through the <I>IfcClassificationNotation</I> class. For a given
		object, the <I>IfcRelAssociatesClassification</I> class makes the connection
		between the <I>IfcObject</I> and the <I>IfcClassificationNotation</I>. </P> 
	 <P>It is a requirement that a classification notation can only bring
		together facets from the same classification system or source. Bringing
		together notation facets from different sources within the same classification
		notation is not allowed. However, multiple classifications can be applied to a
		single object through the use of more than one instance of
		<I>IfcRelAssociatesClassification</I>. In this way it is possible to define
		multiple classification notations where each notation contains facets from a
		single source. </P>
