<P><U>Definition from IAI:</U>
  Representation of a complex number expressed as an array with two elements.
  The first element (index 1) denotes the real component, i.e. the numerical
  component of a complex number whose square roots can be calculated explicitly.
  The second element (index 2) denotes the imaginary component, i.e. numerical
  component of a complex number whose square roots cannot be determined other
  than through the provision of the square of the imaginary number j where j^2 = -1.
  Note that the imaginary component may be referred to as i in certain references.
