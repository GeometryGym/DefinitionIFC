<P><U>Definition from IAI</U>: A defined type of simple data type REAL (required since a select type, i.e. 
<I>IfcSimpleValue</I>, cannot include directly simple types in its select list).

In principle, the domain of <I>IfcReal</I> (being a Real) is all rational, irrational and scientific real numbers. 
Here the precision is unconstrained, but in practice it is implementation specific.
<P>
Type: REAL
