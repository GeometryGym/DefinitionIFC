<p><u>Definition from IAI</u>: A set of units which
may be assigned. Within an <i>IfcUnitAssigment</i> each
unit definition shall be unique. I.e.
there shall be no redundant unit definitions for the same unit type,
like length unit, area unit etc. For currencies, there shall be only a
single <i>IfcMonetaryUnit</i> within an <i>IfcUnitAssignment</i>.</p>
<blockquote><small>
NOTE&nbsp; A project (<i>IfcProject</i>) has a unit
assignment which establishes a set of units which will be used globally
within the project, if not otherwise defined. Other objects may have
local unit assignments if there is a requirement for them to make use
of units which do not fall within the project unit assignment.</small>
