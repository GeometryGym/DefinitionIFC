	 <P>The <I>IfcMeasureResource</I> schema specifies units and defined measure
		types that may be assigned to quantities. The fundamental unit types used in
		this schema are based on the SI system defined in ISO 1000+A1, 1992, 1998. Units
		in measurement systems other than SI may be derived using this schema.</P> 
	 <P> The <I>IfcMeasureResource</I> schema is adapted from the ISO/CD
		10303-41:1992, Industrial Automation Systems and Integration: Product Data
		Representation and Exchange Part 41: Integrated generic resources: Fundamentals
		of product description and support, and its Measure schema. For more
		information on the definitions as defined in the formal ISO standard please
		refer to: ISO/IS 10303-41:1994. The formal standard can be obtained through the
		local publishers of standards in each individual country. </P> 
	 <P> The measure types and units have been heavily expanded from those of
		ISO/CD 10303-41, in order to meet particular IAI domain requirements. Also,
		adaptions have been made according to the modelling rules of IFC development,
		especially not allowing ANDOR subtype constraint. A summary of SI base and
		derived units, related enumeration types and values, and defined measure types
		can be found below:<BR>

		Summary in PDF-format</A> </P> 
	 <P>Some examples of instantiation of the units and measures can be found
		from:<BR><A HREF="lexical/text/IFC_2x2_MeasureUnit_Examples.pdf">Units and
		Measures Examples in PDF-format</A></P>

		the use of superscript font has been omitted. Therefore, m2 means square metre,
