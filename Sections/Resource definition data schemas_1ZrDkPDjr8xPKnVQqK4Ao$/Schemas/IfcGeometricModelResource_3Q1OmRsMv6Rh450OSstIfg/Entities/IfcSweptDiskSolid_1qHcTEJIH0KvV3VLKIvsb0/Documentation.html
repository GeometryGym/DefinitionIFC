	 <P><U>Definition from ISO/FDIS 10303-42-ed3:2002</U>: A swept disk solid is
		the solid produced by sweeping a circular disk along a three dimensional curve.
		During the sweeping operation the normal to the plane of the circular disk is
		in the direction of the tangent to the directrix curve and the center of the
		disk lies on the directrix. The circular disk may, optionally, have a central
		hole, in this case the resulting solid has a through hole, or, an internal void
		when the directrix forms a close curve.</P>
