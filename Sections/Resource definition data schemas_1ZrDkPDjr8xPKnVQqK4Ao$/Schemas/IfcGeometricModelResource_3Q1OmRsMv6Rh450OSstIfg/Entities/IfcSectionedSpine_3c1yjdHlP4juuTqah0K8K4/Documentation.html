	 <P><U>Definition from IAI</U>: A sectioned spine (<I>IfcSectionedSpine</I>)
		is a representation of the shape of a three dimensional object composed by a
		number of planar cross sections, and a spine curve. The shape is defined
		between the first element of cross sections and the last element of the cross
		sections. A sectioned spine may be used to represent a surface or a solid but
		the interpolation of the shape between the cross sections is not defined. </P> 
	 <P>For the representation of a solid all cross sections are areas. For
		representation of a surface all cross sections are curves. The cross sections
		are defined as profiles, whereas the consecutive profiles may be derived by a
		transformation of the start profile or the previous consecutive profile.</P> 
	 <P>The spine curve shall be of type <I>IfcCompositeCurve</I>, each of its
		segments (<I>IfcCompositeCurveSegment</I>) shall correspond to the part between
		exactly two consecutive cross-sections.</P>
