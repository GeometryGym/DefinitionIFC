	 <P><U>Definition from ISO/CD 10303-42:1992</U>: A shell based surface model
		is described by a set of open or closed shells of dimensionality 2. The shells
		shall not intersect except at edges and vertices. In particular, distinct faces
		may not intersect. A complete face of one shell may be shared with another
		shell. Coincident portions of shells shall both reference the same faces, edges
		and vertices defining the coincident region. There shall be at least one
		shell.</P> 
	 <P>A shell may exist independently of a surface model.</P>
