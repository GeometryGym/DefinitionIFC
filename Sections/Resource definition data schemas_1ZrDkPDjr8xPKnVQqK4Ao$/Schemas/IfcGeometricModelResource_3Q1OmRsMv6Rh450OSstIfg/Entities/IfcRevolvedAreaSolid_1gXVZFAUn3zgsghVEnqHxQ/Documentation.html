	 <P><U>Definition from IAI</U>: A revolved area solid
		(<I>IfcRevolvedAreaSolid</I>) is a solid created by revolving a planar bounded
		surface about an axis. Both, the axis and planar bounded surface shall be in
		the same plane and the axis shall not intersect the interior of the swept area.
		If the swept area has inner boundaries, i.e. holes defined, then those holes
		shall be swept into holes of the solid. The direction of revolution is
		clockwise when viewed along the axis in the positive direction. </P>

		<P><FONT SIZE="-1">NOTE: The <I>IfcRevolvedAreaSolid</I> now directly
		  defines the revolution of a cross section (also referred to as profile). It
		  thereby combines the functionality of the previous IfcAttDrivenRevolvedSegment
		  entity. In contrary to the previous IfcAttDrivenRevolvedSegment, the additional
		  start angle attribute has been omitted. The axis is required to lie in the xy
		  plane of the position coordinate system.</FONT></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
