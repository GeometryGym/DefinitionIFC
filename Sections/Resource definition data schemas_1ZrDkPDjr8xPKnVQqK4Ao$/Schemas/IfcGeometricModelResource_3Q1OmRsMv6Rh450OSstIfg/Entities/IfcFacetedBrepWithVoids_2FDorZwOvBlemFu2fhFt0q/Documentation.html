	 <P><U>Definition from IAI</U>: The <I>IfcFacetedBrepWithVoids</I> is a
		specialization of a faceted B-rep which contains one or more voids in its
		interior. The voids are represented as closed shells which are defined so that
		the shell normal point into the void. </P>

		  brep_with_voids (see note above). Please refer to ISO/IS 10303-42:1994, p. 173
		  for the final definition of the formal standard. In IFC faceted B-rep with
		  voids is represented by this subtype <I>IfcFacetedBrepWithVoids</I> and not
		  defined via an implicit ANDOR supertype constraint as in ISO/IS 10303-42:1994
		  between an instance of faceted_brep AND brep_with_voids. This change has been
		  made due to the fact, that only ONEOF supertype constraint is allowed within
		  the IFC object model. </FONT></P>

		<LI>Each void shell shall be disjoint from the outer shell and from every
