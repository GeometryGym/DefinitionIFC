	 <P><U>Definition from ISO/CD 10303-42:1992</U>: A half space solid is
		defined by the half space which is the regular subset of the domain which lies
		on one side of an unbounded surface. The side of the surface which is in the
		half space is determined by the surface normal and the agreement flag. If the
		agreement flag is TRUE, then the subset is the one the normal points away from.
		If the agreement flag is FALSE, then the subset is the one the normal points
		into. For a valid half space solid the surface shall divide the domain into
		exactly two subsets. Also, within the domain the surface shall be manifold and
		all surface normals shall point into the same subset. </P>
