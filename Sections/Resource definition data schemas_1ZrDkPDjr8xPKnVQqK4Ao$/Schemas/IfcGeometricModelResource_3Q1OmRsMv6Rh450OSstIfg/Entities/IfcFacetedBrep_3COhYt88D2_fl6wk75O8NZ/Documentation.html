	 <P><U>Definition from ISO/CD 10303-42:1992</U>: A faceted brep is a simple
		form of boundary representation model in which all faces are planar and all
		edges are straight lines. Unlike the B-rep model, edges and vertices are not
		represented explicitly in the model but are implicitly available through the
		poly loop entity. A faceted B-rep has to meet the same topological constraints
		as the manifold solid Brep. </P>

		<P><FONT SIZE="-1">NOTE: The faceted brep has been introduced in order to
		  support the larger number of systems that allow boundary type solid
		  representations with planar surfaces only.</FONT></P></BLOCKQUOTE>

		final definition of the formal standard. In the current IFC Release faceted
		B-rep with voids is represented by an own subtype and not defined via an
		implicit ANDOR supertype constraint as in ISO/IS 10303-42:1994. This change has
		been made due to the fact, that only ONEOF supertype constraint is allowed
		within the IFC object model. </FONT>
