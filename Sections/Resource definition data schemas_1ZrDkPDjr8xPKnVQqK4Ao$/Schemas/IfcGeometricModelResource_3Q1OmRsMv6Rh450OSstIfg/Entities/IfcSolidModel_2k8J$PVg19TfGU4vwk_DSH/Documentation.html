	 <P><U>Definition from ISO/CD 10303-42:1992:</U> A solid model is a complete
		representation of the nominal shape of a product such that all points in the
		interior are connected. Any point can be classified as being inside, outside,
		or on the boundary of a solid. There are several different types of solid model
		representations. </P>

		  solid_model, only three subtypes have been incorporated into the current IFC
		  Release - subset of manifold_solid_brep (<I>IfcManifoldSolidBrep</I>,
		  constraint to faceted B-rep), swept_area_solid (<I>IfcSweptAreaSolid</I>), the
		  swept_disk_solid (<I>IfcSweptDiskSolid</I>) and subset of csg_solid
		  (<I>IfcCsgSolid</I>). The derived attribute <I>Dim</I> has been added at this
		  level and was therefore demoted from the geometric_representation_item. Please
