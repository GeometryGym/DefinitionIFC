	 <P><U>Definition from IAI</U>: The <I>IfcGeometricSet</I> is used for the
		exchange of shape representations consisting of (2D or 3D) points, curves,
		and/or surfaces, which do not have a topological structure (such as connected
		face sets or shells) and are not solid models (such as swept solids, CSG or
		Brep)</P>
