	 <P><U>Definition from IAI</U>: The extruded area solid
		(<I>IfcExtrudedAreaSolid</I>) is defined by sweeping a bounded planar surface.
		The direction of the extrusion is given by the <I>ExtrudedDirection</I>
		attribute and the length of the extrusion is given by the <I>Depth</I>
		attribute. If the planar area has inner boundaries, i.e. holes defined, then
		those holes shall be swept into holes of the solid.</P> 
	 <BLOCKQUOTE> 
		<P><FONT SIZE="-1"><U>New</U>: The <I>IfcExtrudedArea</I> solid now
		  directly defines the linear extrusion of a cross section (also referred to as
		  profile). It thereby combines the functionality of the previous
		  IfcAttDrivenExtrudedSegment entity. In contrary to the previous
		  IfcAttDrivenExtrudedSegment, the extruded direction can be any which is not
		  perpendicular to the z axis of the position coordinate
		  system.</FONT></P></BLOCKQUOTE> 
	 <P>The <I>ExtrudedDirection</I> is given within the position coordinate
		system as defined by <I>IfcSweptAreaSolid.Position</I>. Extrusions are not
		longer restricted to be perpendicular to the extruded surface of the
		profile.</P>
