	 <P><U>Definition from ISO/CD 10303-42:1992</U>: A face based surface model
		is described by a set of connected face sets of dimensionality 2. The connected
		face sets shall not intersect except at edges and vertices, except that a face
		in one connected face set may overlap a face in another connected face set,
		provided the face boundaries are identical. There shall be at least one
		connected face set. </P> 
	 <P>A connected face set may exist independently of a surface model.</P>
