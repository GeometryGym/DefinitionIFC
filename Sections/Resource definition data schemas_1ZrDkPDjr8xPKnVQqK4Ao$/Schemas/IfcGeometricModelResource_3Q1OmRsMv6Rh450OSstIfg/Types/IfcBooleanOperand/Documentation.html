	 <P><U>Definition from ISO/CD 10303-42:1992</U>: This select type identifies
		all those types of entities which may participate in a Boolean operation to
		form a CSG solid. </P> 
	 <P><U>Definition from IAI</U>: CSG primitives are out of scope for the
		current IFC Release. Only faceted B-reps, swept area solids and half space
		solids are available as Boolean operands. Boolean results themselves can be used
		as operands thus enabling nested Boolean operations.</P>
