	 <P><U>Definition from ISO/CD 10303-42:1992</U>: This type identifies the
		types of entity which may be selected as the root of a CSG tree including a
		single CSG primitive as a special case (currently not in IFC). </P> 
	 <P><U>Definition from IAI</U>: In the current IFC Release only Boolean
		result (<I>IfcBooleanResult</I>) is defined for being a root tree expression
		(at <I>IfcCsgSolid</I>). CSG primitives are out of scope for the current IFC
		Release. </P>
