modeled as <i>IfcMaterialLayerSet</i>
consisting of three <i>IfcMaterialLayer</i>'s:
brick, air cavity and brick.</font>

<p><b><u>Geometry
use</u></b></p>
<p>Each <i>IfcMaterialLayerSet</i>
implicitly defines a reference line (MlsBase), to which the start of
the first <i>IfcMaterialLayer</i>
is aligned. The total thickness of a
layer set is calculated from the individual layer thicknesses, the
first layer starting from the reference line and following layers being
placed on top of the previous (no gaps or overlaps).</p>
