<p><u>Definition from CSS1 (W3C
Recommendation)</u>: The font-style property selects between normal (sometimes
referred to as "roman" or "upright"), italic and oblique faces within
a font family. Values are:</p>
<ul>
  <li>normal </li>
  <li>italic </li>
  <li>oblique</li>
</ul>
<p>A value of 'normal' selects a font that is classified as 'normal'
in the user agents font database, while 'oblique' selects a font that
is labeled 'oblique'. A value of 'italic' selects a font that is labeled
'italic', or, if that is not available, one labeled 'oblique'. The font
that is labeled 'oblique' in the user agents font database may
actually have been generated by electronically slanting a normal font.
</p>
<p>Fonts with Oblique, Slanted or Incline in their names will
typically be labeled 'oblique' in the user agents font database. Fonts
with
<em>Italic, Cursive</em> or <em>Kursiv</em> in
their names will
typically be labeled 'italic'.
