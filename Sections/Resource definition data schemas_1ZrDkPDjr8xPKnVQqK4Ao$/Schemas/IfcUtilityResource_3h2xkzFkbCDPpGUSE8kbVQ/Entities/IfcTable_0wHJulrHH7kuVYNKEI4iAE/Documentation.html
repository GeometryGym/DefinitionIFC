	 <P><U>Definition from IAI</U>: A data structure for the provision of
		information in the form of rows and columns. Each instance may have a heading
		row with titles or descriptions for each column. The rows of information are
		stored as a list of <I>IfcTableRow</I> objects.</P> 
	 <P>Limitation: In this release of IFC the rows of an <I>IfcTable</I> object
		are constrained to have the same number of cells. The first Row of the table
		provides the number of cells. All other rows are forced to include the same
		number of cells. This is enforced by the WR2.</P>
