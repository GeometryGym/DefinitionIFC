	<p><u>Definition from IAI</u>:
    Enumeration identifying the state or accessibility of the object
    (e.g., read/write, locked, etc.). This concept was initially
    introduced in IFC 2.0 as <i>IfcModifiedFlag</i> of type BINARY(3) FIXED
    and has been modified in R2x to an enumeration. It was
    initially introduced as a first step towards providing facilities
    for partial model exchange from a server as requested by the IFC
    implementers. It is intended for use primarily by a model server
    so that an application can identify the state of the object.</p>

    <p>Valid enumerations are:</p>
	<ul>
		<li><b>READWRITE</b>:       Object is in a Read-Write state. It may
        					        be modified by an application.</li>
		<li><b>READONLY</b>:        Object is in a Read-Only state. It may
        					        be viewed but not modified by an application.</li>
		<li><b>LOCKED</b>:          Object is in a Locked state. It may not
        					        be accessed by an application.</li>
		<li><b>READWRITELOCKED</b>: Object is in a Read-Write-Locked state. It
        					        may not be accessed by an application.</li>
		<li><b>READONLYLOCKED</b>:  Object is in a Read-Only-Locked state. It
        					        may not be accessed by an application.</li>
		</ul>
