	<p><u>Definition from IAI</u>:
    Enumeration identifying the type of change that might have occurred
    to the object during the last session (e.g., unchanged, added,
    deleted, etc.). This information is required in a partial model
    exchange scenario so that an application or model server will know
    how an object might have been affected by the previous application.
    Valid enumerations are:</p>
	<ul>
		<li><b>NOCHANGE</b>:       Object has not been modified. This is the
        					       default state.</li>
		<li><b>MODIFIED</b>:       A modification to the object has been made
        					       by the user and application defined by the
                                   LastModifyingUser and LastModifyingApplication
                                   respectively.</li>
		<li><b>ADDED</b>:          The object has been added by the user and
        					       application defined by the LastModifyingUser
                                   and LastModifyingApplication respectively.</li>
		<li><b>DELETED</b>:        The object has been deleted by the user and
        					       application defined by the LastModifyingUser
                                   and LastModifyingApplication respectively.</li>
		<li><b>MODIFIEDADDED</b>:  The object has been added and modified
        					       by the user and application defined by the
                                   LastModifyingUser and LastModifyingApplication
                                   respectively.</li>
		<li><b>MODIFIEDDELETED</b>:  The object has been modified and deleted
        					       by the user and application defined by the
                                   LastModifyingUser and LastModifyingApplication
                                   respectively.</li>
	</ul>

    <p>Note that only the first four enumerations should be used. The MODIFIEDADDED
    and MODIFIEDDELETED are left for compatibility purposes but should not be used.
    </p>
    <p>Consider Application A receives an IFC dataset, adds a new object
    and sets <i>IfcChangeActionEnum</i> to ADDED. Application B then receives
    this IFC dataset but doesn't do anything to the object added by
    Application A. Consequently, the object's <i>IfcChangeActionEnum</i>
    remains set at ADDED. Consequently, the intent is that an
    application only modifies the value of <i>IfcChangeActionEnum</i> when
    it does something to the object, with the further intent that a
    model server is responsible for clearing the <i>IfcChangeActionEnum</i>
    back to UNCHANGED when it is checked back into the repository.</p>
