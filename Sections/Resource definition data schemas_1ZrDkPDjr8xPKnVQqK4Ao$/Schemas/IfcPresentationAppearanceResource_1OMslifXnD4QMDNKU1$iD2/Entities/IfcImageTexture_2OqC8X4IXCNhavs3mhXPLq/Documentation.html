<p><u>Definition
from IAI: </u> An <i>IfcImageTexture</i>
provides a 2-dimensional distribution of the lighting parameters of a
surface onto which it is mapped.</p>
<p>The following additional
definitions from ISO/IEC FCD 19775:200x, the Extensible 3D (<a
 href="http://www.web3d.org/x3d/specifications/x3d_specification.html">X3D</a>)
specification, apply: </p>
<ul>
  <li>The ImageTexture node
defines a texture map by specifying an image file and general
parameters for mapping to geometry. Texture maps are defined in a 2D
coordinate system (s, t) that ranges from [0.0, 1.0] in both
directions. The bottom edge of the image corresponds to the S-axis of
the texture map, and left edge of the image corresponds to the T-axis
of the texture map. The lower-left pixel of the image corresponds to
s=0, t=0, and the top-right pixel of the image corresponds to s=1, t=1.</li>
  <li>The texture is read from the
URL specified by the url [reference attribute]. When the url field
contains no values ([]), texturing is disabled. Browsers shall support
the JPEG and PNG image file formats. Support for the GIF format is also
recommended (including transparency).</li>
</ul>
<p>The following general
recommendations for image file format support from ISO/IEC FCD
19775:200x, the Extensible 3D (<a
 href="http://www.web3d.org/x3d/specifications/x3d_specification.html">X3D</a>)
specification, also apply: </p>
<p>Texture nodes that require
support for the PNG image format shall interpret the PNG pixel formats
in the following way: </p>
<ol type="a">
  <li> Greyscale pixels without
alpha or simple transparency are treated as intensity textures. </li>
  <li> Greyscale pixels with alpha
or simple transparency are treated as intensity plus alpha textures. </li>
  <li> RGB pixels without alpha
channel or simple transparency are treated as full RGB textures. </li>
  <li> RGB pixels with alpha
channel or simple transparency are treated as full RGB plus alpha
textures. </li>
</ol>
<p>If the image specifies colours
as indexed-colour (i.e., palettes or colourmaps), the following
semantics should be used (note that `greyscale' refers to a palette
entry with equal red, green, and blue values): </p>
<ol type="a">
  <li> If all the colours in the
palette are greyscale and there is no transparency chunk, it is treated
as an intensity texture. </li>
  <li> If all the colours in the
palette are greyscale and there is a transparency chunk, it is treated
as an intensity plus opacity texture. </li>
  <li> If any colour in the
palette is not grey and there is no transparency chunk, it is treated
as a full RGB texture. </li>
  <li> If any colour in the
palette is not grey and there is a transparency chunk, it is treated as
a full RGB plus alpha texture. </li>
</ol>
<p>Texture nodes that require
support for JPEG files shall interpret JPEG files as follows: </p>
<ol type="a">
  <li> Greyscale files (number of
components equals 1) are treated as intensity textures. </li>
  <li> YCbCr files are treated as
full RGB textures. </li>
  <li> No other JPEG file types
are required. It is recommended that other JPEG files are treated as a
full RGB textures.</li>
</ol>
<p>Texture nodes that recommend
support for GIF files shall follow the applicable semantics described
above for the PNG format.</p>
