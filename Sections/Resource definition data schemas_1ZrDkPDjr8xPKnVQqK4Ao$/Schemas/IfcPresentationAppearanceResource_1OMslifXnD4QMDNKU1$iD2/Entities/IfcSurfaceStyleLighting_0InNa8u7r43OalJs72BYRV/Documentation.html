	 <P><U>Definition from IAI: </U> <I>IfcSurfaceStyleLighting</I> is a
		container class for properties for calculation of physically exact illuminance
		related to a particular surface style. </P>

	 <P>The illustration above shows the reflection and transmission components
		from an incident ray. The sum of the components for reflection and transmission
		is a value of 1.0 denoting that the incident ray is completely decomposed into
		reflection and transmission components. Each value of reflection and
		transmission is therefore within the range 0.0 to 1.0.</P> 
	 <P>All these factors can be measured physically and are ratios for the red,
		green and blue part of the light. These properties are defined in the model as
		Type <I>IfcColorRGB</I> with a factor for each colour. </P>

		  its transmission factor is 0.0 for red, between 0.0 and 1.0 for green and 0.0
		  for blue. A green surface reflects only green light, so the reflectance factor
		  is 0.0 for red, between 0.0 and 1.0 for green and 0.0 for blue.
