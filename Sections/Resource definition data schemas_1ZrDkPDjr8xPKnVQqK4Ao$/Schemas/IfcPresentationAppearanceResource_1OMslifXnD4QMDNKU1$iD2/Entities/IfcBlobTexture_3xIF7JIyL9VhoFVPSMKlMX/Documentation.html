<p><u>Definition from IAI:</u> An <i>IfcBlobTexture</i>
provides a
2-dimensional distribution of the lighting parameters of a surface onto
which it is mapped. The texture itself is given as a single binary,
representing the content of a pixel format. The file format of the
pixel file is given by the <i>RasterFormat</i> attribute
and allowable formats&nbsp;are guided by where rule WR41.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><small>NOTE &nbsp;Toolbox specific implementations
of the binary datatype may restrict the maximum length of the binary to
capture the binary file content.</small></p>

<p>For interpretation of the texture nodes see <i>IfcImageTexture</i>
