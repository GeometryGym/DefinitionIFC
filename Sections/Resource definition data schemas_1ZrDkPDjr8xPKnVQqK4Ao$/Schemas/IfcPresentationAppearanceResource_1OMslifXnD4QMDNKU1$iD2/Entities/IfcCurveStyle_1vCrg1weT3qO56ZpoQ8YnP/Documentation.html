<p><u>Definition
from ISO/CD 10303-46:1992</u>: A curve style specifies
the visual appearance of curves.</p>
<p><u>Definition from IAI</u>: An <i>IfcCurveStyle</i>
provides the
style table for presentation information assigned to geometric curves.
The style is defined by a color, a font and a width. <font
 color="#0000ff">The <i>IfcCurveStyle&nbsp;</i>defines
curve patterns as model patterns, i.e. the distance between visible and
invisible segments of
curve patterns are given in model space dimensions (that
have to be scaled using the target plot scale). </font></p><p>Styles
are
intended to be shared by multiple <i>IfcStyledItem</i>'s,
assigning
the style to occurrences of (subtypes of) <i>IfcGeometricRepresentationItem</i>'s.
Measures given to a font pattern or a curve width are given in global
drawing length units. <br>
</p><blockquote> <p><small>NOTE&nbsp;
global units are defined at the single <i>IfcProject</i>
instance, given by <i>UnitsInContext:IfcUnitAssignment</i>,
the same
units are used for the geometric representation items and for the style
definitions.</small></p>
</blockquote><p>The measure values for font
pattern and curve width <font color="#0000ff">apply to
the
model space </font>with
a target plot scale provided for the correct appearance in the default
plot scale.. For different scale and projection dependent curve styles
a
different instance of <i>IfcCurveStyle</i>
needs to be used by <i>IfcPresentationStyleAssignment</i>
for different <i>IfcGeometricRepresentationSubContext</i>
dependent
representations.</p>
<blockquote> <small>NOTE&nbsp;
the target plot scale is given by <i>IfcGeometricRepresentationSubContext.TargetScale</i>.</small><br>
</blockquote><p>An <i>IfcCurveStyle</i> can be
assigned to <i>IfcGeometricRepresentationItem</i>'s
via the <i>IfcPresentationStyleAssignment</i>
through an intermediate <i>IfcStyledItem</i>
or <i>IfcAnnotationCurveOccurrence</i>.</p>
