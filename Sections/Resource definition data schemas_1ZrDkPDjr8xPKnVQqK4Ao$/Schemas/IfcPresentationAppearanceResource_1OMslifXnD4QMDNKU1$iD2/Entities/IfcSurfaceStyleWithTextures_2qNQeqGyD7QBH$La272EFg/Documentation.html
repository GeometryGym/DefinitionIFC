<p><u>Definition
from IAI</u>: The entity <i>IfcSurfaceStyleWithTextures</i>
allows for the assignment of image textures to surface styles. These
image textures can be applied repeating across the surface or mapped
with a particular scale upon the surface.</p>
<p>The entity <i>IfcSurfaceStyleWithTextures</i>
is part of the surface style table for presentation information
assigned to surfaces for shading, rendering and lighting with textures.
The mapping of the texture onto the surface or the solid is determined
by the texture coordinates, each <i>IfcAnnotationSurfaceOccurrence</i>
has a <i>TextureCoordinates</i>
attribute, referencing the texture
coordinates for the occurrence of the <i>IfcSurfaceStyleWithTextures</i>.</p>
