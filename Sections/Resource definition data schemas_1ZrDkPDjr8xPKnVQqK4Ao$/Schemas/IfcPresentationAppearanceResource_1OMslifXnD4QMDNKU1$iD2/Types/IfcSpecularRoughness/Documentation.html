	 <P><U>Definition from IAI</U>: The <I>IfcSpecularRoughness</I> defines the
		datatype for the reflection resulting from the roughness of a surface through
		the height of surface impurities where the specular highlight is made sharper
		with small values for the roughness, such as 0.1. </P> 
	 <P>Applies to "glass", "metal", "mirror" and "plastic" reflection models.
		Larger values, close to 1.0 decrease the specular fall-off.</P> 
	 <P><I>IfcSpecularRoughness</I> is of type REAL. It is constraint to values
		between (and including) 0 and 1.</P>

		specular roughness.</FONT></BLOCKQUOTE>
