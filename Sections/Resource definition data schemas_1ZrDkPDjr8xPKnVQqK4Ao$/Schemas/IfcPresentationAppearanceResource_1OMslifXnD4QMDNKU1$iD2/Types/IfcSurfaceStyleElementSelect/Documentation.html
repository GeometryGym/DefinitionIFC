	 <P><U>Definition from ISO/CD 10303-46:1992</U>: The surface style element
		select is a selection of the different surface styles to use in the
		presentation of the side of a surface.</P> 
	 <P><U>Definition from IAI</U>: The select type only includes the
		<I>IfcSurfaceStyleRendering</I> (which is the equivalent to
		surface_style_rendering) from the select type surface_style_element_select. In
		addition it has the <I>IfcSurfaceStyleLighting</I>, which holds the exact
		physically based lighting properties for lighting based calculation algorithms
		(as the opposite to the rendering based calculation), the
		<I>IfcSurfaceStyleRefraction</I> (for more advanced refraction indices) and
		<I>IfcSurfaceStyleWithTextures</I> (to allow for image textures applied to
		surfaces). In addition an <I>IfcExternallyDefinedSurfaceStyle</I> can be
		selected that points into an external material library.</P>

		<P><FONT SIZE="-1">NOTE The <I>IfcSurfaceLightingProperties</I> are
		  needed for exact lighting calculation, because physically based lighting
		  calculation algorithms need exact physically based parameters. The factors in
		  <I>IfcSurfaceStyleRendering</I> lack the physical base, they are intended for
		  rendering calculations, but a lighting calculation based software cannot use
		  these values.</FONT></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
