<p><u>Enumeration
values:</u></p>
<p><i><b>Curve</b></i><br>
The resulting geometric item is of type curve and closed (with the only
exception of the curve created by the <i>IfcArbitraryOpenProfileDef</i>
which resolves into an open curve). The resulting geometry after
applying a sweeping operation is a swept surface. This can be used to
define shapes with thin sheets, such as ducts, where the thickness is
not appropriate for geometric representation.</p>
<p><i><b>Area</b></i><br>
The resulting geometric item is of type surface. The resulting geometry
after applying a sweeping operation is a swept solid with defined
volume.</p>
