	 <P><U>Definition from ISO/CD 10303-42:1992:</U> A loop is a topological
		entity constructed from a single vertex, or by stringing together connected
		(oriented) edges, or linear segments beginning and ending at the same vertex.
		It is typically used to bound a face lying on a surface. A loop has
		dimensionality of 0 or 1. The domain of a 0-dimensional loop is a single point.
		The domain of a 1-dimensional loop is a connected, oriented curve, but need not
		to be manifold. As the loop is a circle, the location of its beginning/ending
		point is arbitrary. The domain of the loop includes its bounds, an 0 &le; &Xi;
		&lt; &infin;. </P> 
	 <P>A loop is represented by a single vertex, or by an ordered collection of
		oriented edges, or by an ordered collection of points. A loop is a graph, so
		<I>M</I> and the graph genus <I>G<SUP>l</SUP></I> may be determined by the
		graph traversal algorithm. Since <I>M </I>= 1, the Euler equation (1) reduces
		in this case to </P>
