	 <P><U>Definition from ISO/CD 10303-42:1992</U>: An edge curve is a special
		subtype of edge which has its geometry fully defined. The geometry is defined
		by associating the edge with a curve which may be unbounded. As the topological
		and geometric directions may be opposed, an indicator (same sense) is used to
		identify whether the edge and curve directions agree or are opposed. The
		Boolean value indicates whether the curve direction agrees with (TRUE) or is in
		the opposite direction (FALSE) to the edge direction. Any geometry associated
		with the vertices of the edge shall be consistent with the edge geometry. </P>
