<p><u>Definition from ISO/CD 10303-42:1992</u>: A
poly loop is a loop with straight edges bounding a planar region in
space. A poly loop is a loop of genus 1 where the loop is represented
by an ordered coplanar collection of points forming the vertices of the
loop. The loop is composed of straight line segments joining a point in
the collection to the succeeding point in the collection. The closing
segment is from the last to the first point in the collection.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The direction of the loop is in the direction of the line
segments. </p>

<p>A poly loop shall conform to the following topological
constraints:</p>
<dl>
  <dd>- the loop has the genus of one.</dd>
  <dd>- the following equation shall be satisfied

<p><u>Definition from IAI</u>: &nbsp;The <i>IfcPolyLoop</i>
is always closed and the last segment is from the last <i>IfcCartesianPoint</i>
in the list of <i>Polygon</i>'s to the first <i>IfcCartesianPoint</i>.
Therefore the first point shall not be repeated at the end of the list,
neither by referencing the same instance, nor by using an additional
instance of&nbsp;<i>IfcCartesianPoint</i> having the
coordinates as the first point.&nbsp;</p>
