	 <P><U>Definition from ISO/CD 10303-42:1992</U>: An open shell is a shell of
		the dimensionality 2. Its domain, if present, is a finite, connected, oriented,
		2-manifold with boundary, but is not a closed surface. It can be thought of as
		a closed shell with one or more holes punched in it. The domain of an open
		shell satisfies 0
		&lt; &Xi; &lt; 1. An open shell is
		functionally more general than a face because its domain can have handles.</P> 
	 <P>The shell is defined by a collection of faces, which may be oriented
		faces. The sense of each face, after taking account of the orientation, shall
		agree with the shell normal as defined below. The orientation can be supplied
		directly as a BOOLEAN attribute of an oriented face, or be defaulted to TRUE if
		the shell member is a face without the orientation attribute.</P> 
	 <P>The following combinatorial restrictions on open shells and geometrical
		restrictions on their domains are designed, together with the informal
		propositions, to ensure that any domain associated with an open shell is an
		orientable manifold.</P> 
	 <UL> 
		<LI>Each face reference shall be unique. </LI> 
		<LI>An open shell shall have at least one face. </LI> 
		<LI>A given face may exist in more than one open shell.</LI> 
	 </UL> 
	 <P>The boundary of an open shell consists of the edges that are referenced
		only once by the face - bounds (loops) of its faces, together with all of their
		vertices. The domain of an open shell, if present, contains all edges and
		vertices of its faces.</P>

		<P><FONT SIZE="-1">NOTE Note that this is slightly different from the
		  definition of a face domain, which includes none of its bounds. For example, a
		  face domain may exclude an isolated point or line segment. An open shell domain
		  may not. (See the algorithm for computing below.)</FONT></P></BLOCKQUOTE> 
	 <P><U>Definition from IAI</U>: In the current IFC Release only poly loops
		(<I>IfcPolyLoop</I>) are defined for bounds of face bound
		(<I>IfcFaceBound.Bound</I>). This will allow for faceted B-rep only. For
		further specification, including the Euler formulas to be satisfied, please
		refer to ISO 10303-42:1994.</P>

	 <OL> 
		<LI>Every edge shall be referenced exactly twice by the face bounds of
		  the face. </LI> 
		<LI>Each oriented edge shall be unique. </LI> 
		<LI>No edge shall be referenced by more than two faces. </LI>

		<LI>Distinct edges do not intersect but may share vertices. </LI> 
		<LI>Each face reference shall be unique. </LI> 
		<LI>The loops of the shell shall not be a mixture of poly loop and other
		  loop types. Note: this is given, since only poly loop is defined as face bound
		  definition. </LI> 
		<LI>The closed shell shall be an oriented arcwise connected 2-manifold.
