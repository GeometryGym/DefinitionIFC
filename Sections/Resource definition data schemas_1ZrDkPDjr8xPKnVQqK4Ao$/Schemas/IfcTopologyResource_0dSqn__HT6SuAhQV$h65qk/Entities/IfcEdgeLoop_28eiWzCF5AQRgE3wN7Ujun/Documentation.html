	 <P><U>Definition from ISO/CD 10303-42:1992</U>: An edge_loop is a loop with
		nonzero extent. It is a path in which the start and end vertices are the same.
		Its domain, if present, is a closed curve. An edge_loop may overlap itself.</P>
	 
	 <P>Informal propositions:</P> 
	 <OL> 
		<LI>The genus of the <I>IfcEdgeLoop</I> shall be 1 or greater.</LI> 
		<LI>The Euler formula shall be satisfied:<BR>(number of vertices) + genus
		  - (number of edges) = 1;</LI> 
		<LI>No edge may be referenced more than once by the same
		  <I>IfcEdgeLoop</I> with the same sense. For this purpose, an edge which is not
		  an oriented edge is considered to be referenced with the sense TRUE.</LI>
