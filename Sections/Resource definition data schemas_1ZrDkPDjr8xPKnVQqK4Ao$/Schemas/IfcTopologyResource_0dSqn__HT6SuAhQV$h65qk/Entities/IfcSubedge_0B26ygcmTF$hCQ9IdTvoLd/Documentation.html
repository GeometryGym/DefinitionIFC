	 <P><U>Definition from ISO/DIS 10303-42:1999(E)</U>: A subedge is an edge
		whose domain is a connected portion of the domain of an existing edge. The
		topological constraints on a subedge are the same as those on an edge.</P> 
	 <P>Informal propositions:</P> 
	 <OL> 
		<LI>The domain of the subedge is formally defined to be the domain of the
		  parent edge, as trimmed by the subedge start vertex and subedge end
		  vertex.</LI> 
		<LI>The start vertex and end vertex shall be within the union of the
		  domains of the vertices of the parent edge and the domain of the <I>parent
		  edge</I>.</LI>
