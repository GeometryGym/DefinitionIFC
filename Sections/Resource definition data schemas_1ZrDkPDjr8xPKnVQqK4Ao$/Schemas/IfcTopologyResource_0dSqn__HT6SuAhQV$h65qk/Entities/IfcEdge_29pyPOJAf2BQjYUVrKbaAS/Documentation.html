	 <P><U>Definition from ISO/CD 10303-42:1992</U>: An edge is the topological
		construct corresponding to the connection of two vertices. More abstractly, it
		may stand for a logical relationship between two vertices. The domain of an
		edge, if present, is a finite,
		non-self-intersecting open curve in <I>R<SUP>M</SUP></I>, that is, a connected
		1-dimensional manifold. The bounds of an edge are two vertices, which need not
		be distinct. The edge is oriented by choosing its traversal direction to run
		from the first to the second vertex. If the two vertices are the same, the edge
		is a self loop. The domain of the edge does not include its bounds, and 0 &le;
		&Xi; &le; &infin;. Associated with an edge may be a geometric curve to locate
		the edge in a coordinate space; this is represented by the edge curve
		(<I>IfcEdgeCurve</I>) subtype. The curve shall be finite and non-self-intersecting
		within the domain of the edge. An edge is a graph, so its multiplicity M and
		graph genus <I>G<SUP>e</SUP></I> may be determined by the graph traversal
		algorithm. Since <I>M</I> = <I>E</I> = 1, the Euler equation (1) reduces in the
		case to </P>
