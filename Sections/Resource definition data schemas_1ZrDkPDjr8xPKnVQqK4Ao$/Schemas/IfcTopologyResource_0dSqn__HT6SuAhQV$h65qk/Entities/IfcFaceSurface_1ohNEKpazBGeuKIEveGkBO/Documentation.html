	 <P><U>Definition from ISO/CD 10303-42:1992</U>: A face surface
		(IfcFaceSurface) is a subtype of face in which the geometry is defined by an
		associated surface. The portion of the surface used by the face shall be
		embeddable in the plane as an open disk, possibly with holes. However, the
		union of the face with the edges and vertices of its bounding loops need not be
		embeddable in the plane. It may, for example, cover an entire sphere or torus.
		As both a face and a geometric surface have defined normal directions, a
		BOOLEAN flag (the orientation attribute) is used to indicate whether the
		surface normal agrees with (TRUE) or is opposed to (FALSE) the face normal
		direction. The geometry associated with any component of the loops of the face
		shall be consistent with the surface geometry, in the sense that the domains of
		all the vertex points and edge curves are contained in the face geometry
		surface. A surface may be referenced by more than one face surface.</P>

		<LI>The domain of the face surface is formally defined to be the domain
		  of its face geometry as trimmed by the loops, this domain does not include the

		<LI>A face surface is a manifold.</LI>

		<LI>A face surface has surface genus 0.</LI>
		<LI>The loops are not part of the face domain.</LI>
		<LI>Loop geometry shall be consistent with face geometry. This implies
		  that any edge - curves or vertex points used in defining the loops bounding the
