	 <P><U>Definition from ISO/CD 10303-42:1992</U>: A closed shell is a shell
		of the dimensionality 2 which typically serves as a bound for a region in R3. A
		closed shell has no boundary, and has non-zero finite extent. If the shell has
		a domain with coordinate space R3, it divides that space into two connected
		regions, one finite and the other infinite. In this case, the topological
		normal of the shell is defined as being directed from the finite to the
		infinite region. </P> 
	 <P>The shell is represented by a collection of faces. The domain of the
		shell, if present, contains all those faces, together with their bounds.
		Associated with each face in the shell is a logical value which indicates
		whether the face normal agrees with (TRUE) or is opposed to (FALSE) the shell
		normal. The logical value can be applied directly as a BOOLEAN attribute of an
		oriented face, or be defaulted to TRUE if the shell boundary attribute member
		is a face without the orientation attribute. </P> 
	 <P>The combinatorial restrictions on closed shells and geometrical
		restrictions on their domains are designed to ensure that any domain associated
		with a closed shell is a closed, orientable manifold. The domain of a closed
		shell, if present, is a connected, closed, oriented 2-manifold. It is always
		topologically equivalent to an <I>H</I>-fold torus for some <I>H</I>
		<FONT FACE="Symbol">&sup3;</FONT> 0. The number <I>H</I> is referred to as the
		surface genus of the shell. If a shell of genus <I>H</I> has a domain within
		coordinate space <I>R<SUP>3</SUP></I>, then the finite region of space inside
		it is topologically equivalent to a solid ball with <I>H</I> tunnels drilled
		through it.</P> 
	 <P>The Euler equation (7) applies with <I>B</I>=0, because in this case
		there are no holes. As in the case of open shells, the surface genus <I>H</I>
		may not be known a priori, but shall be an integer <FONT
		FACE="Symbol">&sup3;</FONT> 0. Thus a necessary, but not sufficient, condition
		for a well-formed closed shell is the following:</P>
