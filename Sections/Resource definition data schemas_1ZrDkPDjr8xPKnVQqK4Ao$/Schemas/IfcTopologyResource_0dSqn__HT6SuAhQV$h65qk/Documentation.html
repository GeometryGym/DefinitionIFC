	 <P>The schema <I>IfcTopologyResource</I> defines the resources used for
		topological representations. The primary application of this resource is its
		use in the Boundary representation of the shape or geometric form of a product
		model.</P> 
	 <BLOCKQUOTE><FONT COLOR="#0000FF">NOTE: The definitions of this resource of
		the IFC model have been taken from the Integrated Resource, part 42 "Integrated
		generic resources: Geometric and topological representations" of the ISO
		standard 10303: "Industrial automation systems and integration - Product data
		representation and exchange". The IfcTopologyResource refers to the clause 5,
		"Topology" of the standard. The reference is ISO/IS 10303-42:1994, pp. 122. The
		improved definitions of the second edition, ISO/DIS 10303-42:1999 have been

	 <P>The definitions taken from ISO/IS 10303-42:1994 have undergone an
		adaptation process, characterized by:</P> 
	 <UL> 
		<LI>adaptation of the IFC naming convention (inner majuscules and Ifc
		  prefix)</LI> 
		<LI>adaptation of the STEP entities, where multiple inheritance or
		  non-exclusive inheritance (i.e. AND or ANDOR subtype constraints) are used</LI>
		
		<LI>selection of a subset of the IR, using subtype and select
		  pruning</LI> 
		<LI>omission of the name attribute at the representation item</LI>

	 <P>The topological representation of the shape is defined following the

		and Integration: Product Data Representation and Exchange - Part 42: Integrated
		Generic Resources. Geometric and Topological Representation</I>. The type,
