	 <P><U>Definition from ISO/CD 10303-42:1992</U> This type collects together,
		for reference when constructing more complex models, the subtypes which have
		the characteristics of a shell. A shell is a connected object of fixed
		dimensionality d = 0; 1; or 2, typically used to bound a region. The domain of
		a shell, if present, includes its bounds and 0 <FONT

		<LI>A shell of dimensionality 0 is represented by a graph consisting of a
		  single vertex. The vertex shall not have any associated edges.</LI> 
		<LI>A shell of dimensionality 1 is represented by a connected graph of
		  dimensionality 1.</LI> 
		<LI>A shell of dimensionality 2 is a topological entity constructed by
		  joining faces along edges. Its domain, if present, is a connected, orientable
		  2-manifold with boundary, that is, a connected, oriented, finite,
		  non-self-intersecting surface, which may be closed or open.</LI>
