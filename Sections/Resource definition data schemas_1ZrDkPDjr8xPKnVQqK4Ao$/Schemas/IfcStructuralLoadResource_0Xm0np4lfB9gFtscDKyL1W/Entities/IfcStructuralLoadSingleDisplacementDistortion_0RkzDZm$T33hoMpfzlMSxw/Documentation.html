	 <P><U>Definition from IAI:</U> Instances of the entity
		<I>IfcStructuralLoadSingleForceWarping</I>, as a subtype of
		<I>IfcStructuralLoadSingleForce</I>, shall be used to define an action operation
		on a single point. In addition to forces and moments defined by its supertype a
		warping moment can be defined. </P> 
	 <P>All values are given within the chosen coordinate system of the
		'activity element' (subtypes of <I>IfcStructuralActivity</I>), either the local
		coordinate system of the activity element or the global project coordinate
		system which is referenced by the activity element as its geometric
		representation context. The units of the displacement and rotation values are
		given within the global unit assignment (<I>IfcUnitAssignment</I>).</P>
