	 <P><U>Definition from IAI:</U> The abstract entity <I>IfcStructuralLoad</I>
		is the supertype of all loads which can be defined (actions or reactions, as
		well as dynamic or static). </P>
	 <P>Subtypes of this entity are an important part of the definition of
		actions and reactions. They are used to specify the load values. The location
		and the used coordinate system are defined by instances of
		<I>IfcStructuralActivity</I> which reference an instance of
		<I>IfcStructuralLoad</I> for the definition of the load values. This offers the
		possibility to use instances of <I>IfcStructuralLoad</I> by several instances
		of <I>IfcStructuralActivity</I>. </P>
