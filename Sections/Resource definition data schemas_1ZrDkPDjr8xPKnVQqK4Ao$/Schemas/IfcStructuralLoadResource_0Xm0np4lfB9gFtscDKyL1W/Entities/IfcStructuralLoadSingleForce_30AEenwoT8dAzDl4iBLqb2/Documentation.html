		<I>IfcStructuralLoadSingleForce</I> shall be used to define the forces and
		moments of an action operating on a single point. </P>
	 <P>All values are given within the chosen coordinate system of the
		'activity element' (subtypes of <I>IfcStructuralActivity</I>), either the local
		coordinate system of the activity element or the global project coordinate
		system which is referenced by the activity element as its geometric
		representation context. The units of the force and moment values are given
