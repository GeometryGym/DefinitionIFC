	 <P><U>Definition from IAI:</U> An instance of the entity
		<I>IfcStructuralLoadTemperature</I> shall be used to define actions which are
		caused by a temperature change. The change of temperature is given with a
		constant value which is applied to the complete section and values for the
		outer fibre of the positive Y and Z directions. </P> 
	 <P>All values are given within the chosen coordinate system of the
		'activity element' (subtypes of <I>IfcStructuralActivity</I>), either the local
		coordinate system of the activity element or the global project coordinate
		system which is referenced by the activity element as its geometric
		representation context. The unit of the temperature values are given within the
		global unit assignment (<I>IfcUnitAssignment</I>).</P>
