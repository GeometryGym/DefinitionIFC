	 <P><U>Definition from IAI</U>: The complex physical quantity,
		<I>IfcPhysicalComplexQuantity</I>, is an entity that holds a set of single
		quantity measure value (as defined at the subtypes of
		<I>IfcPhysicalSimpleQuantity</I>), that all apply to a given component or
		aspect of the element.</P> 
	 <BLOCKQUOTE><FONT SIZE="-1">EXAMPLE: A layered element, like a wall, may
		have several material layers, each having individual quantities, like footprint
		area, side area and volume. An instance of <I>IfcPhysicalComplexQuantity</I>
		would group these individual quantities (given by a subtype of
		<I>IfcPhysicalSimpleQuantity</I>) and name them according to the material layer
		name by using the <I>Name</I> attribute. The <I>Discrimination</I> attribute
		would then be 'layer'.</FONT></BLOCKQUOTE>
	 <P>A section "Quantity Use Definition" at individual entities as subtypes
		of <I>IfcBuildingElement</I> gives guidance to the usage of the <I>Name</I> and
		<I>Discrimination</I> attribute to characterize the complex quantities.</P>
