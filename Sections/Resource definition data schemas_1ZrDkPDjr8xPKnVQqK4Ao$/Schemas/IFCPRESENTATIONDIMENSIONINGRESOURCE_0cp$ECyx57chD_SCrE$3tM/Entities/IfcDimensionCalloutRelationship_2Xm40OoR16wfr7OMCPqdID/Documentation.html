	 <P><U>Definition from IAI</U>: A dimension callout relationship is a
		relationship between two draughting callouts. The relating draughting callout
		refers to a dimension (linear, diameter, radius, or angular) while the related
		draughting callout refers to the dimension text (as structured dimension
		callout). This structured dimension callout can either be denoted as "primary",
		in which case it presents the dimension value in the primary unit, or as
		"secondary", in which case it presents the dimension value in the secondary
		unit.</P>
