	 <P><U>Definition from IAI:</U> An <I>IfcAppliedValue</I> is an abstract
		supertype that specifies the common attributes for cost and environmental
		values that may be applied to objects within the IFC model. </P>

	 <P>The extent of the <I>IfcAppliedValue</I> is determined by the
		<I>AppliedValue</I> attribute which may be defined either as an
		<I>IfcMeasureWithUnit</I> or as an <I>IfcMonetaryMeasure</I> or as an
		<I>IfcRatioMeasure</I> via the <I>IfcAppliedValueSelect</I> type. </P> 
	 <P>Optionally, an <I>IfcAppliedValue</I> may have an applicable date. This
		is intended to fix the date on which the value became relevant for use. It may
		be the date on which the value was set in the model or it may be a prior or
		future date when the value becomes operable. It should be noted that the
		datatype for <I>IfcAppliedValue.ApplicableDate</I> is <I>IfcDateTimeSelect</I>.
		This enables either a calendar date or a date and time to be selected. The
		option of selecting a time only without a date is also possible through this
		select mechanism but should not be used in the case of an applied value. </P>
	 <P>Similarly, an <I>IfcAppliedValue</I> may have a 'fixed until' date. This
		is intended to fix the date on which the value ceases to be relevant for use.
		</P> 
	 <P>An instance of <I>IfcAppliedValue</I> may have a unit basis asserted.
		This is defined as an <I>IfcMeasureWithUnit</I> that determines the extent of
		the unit value for application purposes. It is assumed that when this attribute
		is asserted, then the value given to <I>IfcAppliedValue</I> is that for unit
		quantity. This is not enforced within the IFC schema and thus needs to be
		controlled within an application. </P>
