	 <P>The <I>IfcEnvironmentalImpactValue</I> contains the value of the
		environmental impact. For example this could represent the volume of carbon
		dioxide emission, amount of operational energy or mass of aluminum used in a
		product.</P> 
	 <P>Each instance of <I>IfcEnvironmentalImpactValue</I> may also have an
		ImpactType. There are many possible types of environmental impact value that
		may be identified. To allow for any type of environmental impact value, the
		<I>IfcLabel</I> datatype is assigned. The following defines some impact types
		that might be applied: </P>
