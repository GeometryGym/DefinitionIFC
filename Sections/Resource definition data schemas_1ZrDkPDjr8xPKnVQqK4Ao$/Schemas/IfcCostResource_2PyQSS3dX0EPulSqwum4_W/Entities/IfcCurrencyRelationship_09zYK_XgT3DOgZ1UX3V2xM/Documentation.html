	 <P>An <I>IfcCurrencyRelationship</I> is used where there may be a need to
		reference an IfcCostValue in one currency to an IfcCostValue in another
		currency. It takes account of fact that currency exchange rates may vary by
		requiring the recording the date and time of the currency exchange rate used
		and the source that publishes the rate. There may be many sources and there are
		different strategies for currency conversion (spot rate, forward buying of
		currency at a fixed rate). </P> 
	 <P>The source for the currency exchange is defined as an instance of
		IfcLibraryInformation that includes a name and a location (typically a URL,
		since most rates are now published in reliable sources via the web, although it
		may be a string value defining a location of any type). </P>
