	 <P><U>Definition from IAI:</U> An <I>IfcAppliedValueRelationship</I> is a
		relationship class that enables applied values of cost or environmental impact
		to be aggregated together as components of another applied value.</P>

	 <P>Dependency relationships can exist between applied values on the basis
		that one particular value may be determined by operations on one or more other
		values. This is captured through the <I>IfcAppliedValueRelationship</I> entity.
		In this relationship, one instance of <I>IfcAppliedValue</I> acts as the
		principal (<I>IfcAppliedValueRelationship.ComponentOf</I>) whose value may be
		determined from the instances of <I>IfcAppliedValue</I> that are defined as its
		components (<I>IfcAppliedValueRelationship.Components</I>)</P> 
	 <P>An <I>IfcAppliedValueRelationship</I> has an ArithmeticOperator
		attribute that specifies the form of arithmetical operation implied by the
		relationship.</P> 
	 <P> A practical consideration when using the applied value relationship is
		that when the arithmetic operator is ADD, then the type of the
		<I>IfcAppliedValue.AppliedValue</I> attribute will be <I>IfcMeasureWithUnit</I>
		or <I>IfcMonetaryMeasure</I> while if the arithmetic operator is MULTIPLY,
		then the type of the <I>IfcAppliedValue.AppliedValue</I> attribute for one
		instance of <I>IfcAppliedValue</I> will be <I>IfcMeasureWithUnit</I> or
		<I>IfcMonetaryMeasure</I> while for other instances it will be
		<I>IfcRatioMeasure</I>.</P> 
	 <P><U>Example</U></P> 
	 <P>A relationship exists between applied value A and applied values B, C
		and D such that the value of A is determined by the addition of B, C and D such
		that:</P> 
	 <P ALIGN="CENTER">A = B + C + D </P>

	 <P>It is possible to develop more complex applied value specifications by
		creating hierarchies of applied value relationships. In the diagram below, the
		development of a applied value is shown whereby, because B = E * F and D = G *
		H * J, then:</P> 
	 <P ALIGN="CENTER"> A = ((E * F) + C + (G * H * J)) </P>
