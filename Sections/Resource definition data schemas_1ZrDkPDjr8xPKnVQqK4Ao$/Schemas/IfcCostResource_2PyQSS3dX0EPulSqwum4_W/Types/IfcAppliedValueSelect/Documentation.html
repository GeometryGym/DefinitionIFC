	 <P>Selecting <I>IfcMeasureWithUnit</I> allows the specification of both the
		actual figure for the value together with the currency (for a cost value) or an
		environmental measurement unit (in the case of an environmental impact value)
		in which the value is represented. </P> 
	 <P>Selecting <I>IfcMonetaryMeasure</I> allows the specification only of the
		value, the currency being as set by the global context</P> 
	 <P>Selecting <I>IfcRatioMeasure</I> assumes that the amount is a percentage
		or other REAL number. Note that if the amount is normally specified as -20%,
		then this figure will need to be converted to a multiplier of 0.8 </P>
