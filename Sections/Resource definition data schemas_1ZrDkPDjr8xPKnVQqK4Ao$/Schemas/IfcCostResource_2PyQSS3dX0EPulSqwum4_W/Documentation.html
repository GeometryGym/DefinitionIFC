	 <P>The <I>IfcCostResource</I> schema provides the means to identify cost
		and environmental impact values that may be assigned to an object.</P> 
	 <H3>Applied Value </H3> 
	 <P>An applied value is either a cost or an environmental impact value that
		specifies an amount or a value that has an effect on the amount that is applied
		to an object in the units of measure applicable to the value type. An applied
		value may have an applicable date. In the case of a cost, that can be used to
		provide a basis on which fluctuations in price can be established or that
		otherwise identifies when the cost value was applied. </P> 
	 <P> Each applied value may have a unit basis which determines how a total
		value should be determined for objects. This is relevant where values are
		identified per unit quantity of an item. </P> 
	 <H3>Applied Value Relationship </H3> 
	 <P>An individual applied value may be defined according to the values of a
		set of component values and may also be identified as a component of other
		values. This is achieved through the assertion of an applied value relationship
		which acts as a container for applied value components. </P> 
	 <H3>Referencing Value Documents</H3> 
	 <P>The origin of an applied value may be a documentary source. The
		<I>IfcCostResource</I> schema allows identification of such a source through a
		document reference. <I>IfcReferencesValueDocument</I> is a relationship class
		that allows many instances of <I>IfcAppliedValue</I> to be referenced from a
		single such document. </P>
