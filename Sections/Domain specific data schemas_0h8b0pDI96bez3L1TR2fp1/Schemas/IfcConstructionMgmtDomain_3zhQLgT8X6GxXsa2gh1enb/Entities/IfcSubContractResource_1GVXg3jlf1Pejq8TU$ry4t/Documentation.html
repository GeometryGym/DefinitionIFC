	 <P>An <I>IfcSubContractResource</I> can be used in cost estimating and work
		planning without specifying the subcontractor. However, it can be associated
		with an actor fulfilling the subcontractor role when detailed work planning is
		performed. The type of subcontractor can also be identified in a construction
		crew resource. </P>
