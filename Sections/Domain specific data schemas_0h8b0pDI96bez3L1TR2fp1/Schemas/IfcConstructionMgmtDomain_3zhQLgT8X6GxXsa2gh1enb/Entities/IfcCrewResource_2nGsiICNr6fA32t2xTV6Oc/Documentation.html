	 <P>A construction crew resource typically includes labor resource,
		equipment resource, material resource, subcontractor resource, as well as other
		crew resources. Construction crew resources are partially or wholly consumed,
		or occupied in a construction process (i.e. <I>IfcTask</I>). Since
		<I>IfcCrewResource</I> represents the resource types, individual persons are
		not required to be identified and linked to the crew resource, while they can
		be associated if needed. </P> 
	 <P>The <I>IfcCrewResource</I> is enabled to contain other crew resource
		types (i.e. crew resource type nesting) through its relationship to
		<I>IfcRelNests</I>. </P>
