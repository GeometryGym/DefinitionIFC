	 <P>Occurrences of IfcConstructionMaterialResource are consumed (wholly or
		partially), or occupied during a construction work task (i.e.
		<I>IfcTask</I>).</P> 
	 <P>Similar to <I>IfcConstructionProductResource</I>, sometimes things such
		as 5000kg of gravel are already instantiated as an IfcProduct because it is a
		result of a work task e.g. &#145;transporting gravel&#146;. In this case, the
		instance of <I>IfcConstructionMaterialResource</I> can be associated with the
		product instance &#145;5000kg of gravel&#146; to provide more information for
		resource uses. Nevertheless, <I>IfcConstructionMaterialResource</I> should only
		be used to represent resource types, e.g. &#145;gravel&#146;, but not product
		substances, e.g. &#145;5000kg of gravel&#146;.</P> 
	 <P>Note: This class is not the same as <I>IfcMaterial</I>; the former can
		typically represent the type of bulk materials such as sand, gravels, nails and
		so on (note these can be instantiated from <I>IfcProduct</I> as well depending
		their uses in the system) used in a construction process. The latter is about
		physical materials used in a physical building element typically with detailed
		positioning (e.g. offset) and layering information.</P>
	 <P>The association of an actual material with an
		<I>IfcConstructionMaterialResource</I> is handled by
		<I>IfcRelAssociatesMaterial</I>.</P>
	 <P>Quantities for an <I>IfcConstructionMaterialResource</I> are defined
		through <I>IfcRelDefinesByProperty</I> and use <I>IfcElementQuantity</I>.</P>
