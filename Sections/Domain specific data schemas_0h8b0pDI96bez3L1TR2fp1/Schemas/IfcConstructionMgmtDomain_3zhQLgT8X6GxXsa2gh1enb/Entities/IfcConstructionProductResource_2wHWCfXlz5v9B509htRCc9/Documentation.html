	 <P>Occurrences of products that are used as product resources are instances
		of <I>IfcProduct</I> (by reference) since they result from some processes. For
		instance, formworks can be instantiated as products resulting from the process
		&#145;constructing formwork&#146;. However, they are used as resources in the
		process &#145;pouring concrete&#146; in a later stage of the project. The
		product that is used as a construction resource is referenced using the
		<I>IfcRelAssignsToResource.RelatedObjects</I> relationship.</P>
