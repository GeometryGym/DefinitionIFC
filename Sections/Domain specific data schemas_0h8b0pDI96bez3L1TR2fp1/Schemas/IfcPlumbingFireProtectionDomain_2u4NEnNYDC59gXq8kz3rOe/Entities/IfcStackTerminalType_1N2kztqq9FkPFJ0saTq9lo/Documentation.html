<p><u>Definition from IAI</u>: The <i>IfcStackTerminalType</i>
defines a particular type of <em>IfcFlowTerminal</em>
placed at the top of a ventilating stack (to prevent ingress by birds,
rainwater etc.) or rainwater pipe (to act as a collector or hopper for
discharge from guttering). </p>

<p><u><b>Use Definitions</b></u></p>
<p>An <i>IfcStackTerminalType</i> identifies a
particular type of <i>IfcFlowTerminal</i> that is placed
at the top of a vertical pipe in a waste/drainage/rainwater system to
fulfill a particular purpose. The purpose is by default in the context
of the stack subsystem in which the terminal participates. The
particular type of the stack terminal is defined by the set value of
the stack terminal type enumeration. </p>
<p>An <i>IfcStackTerminalType</i> may be included
into the spatial context of the building model through an (or multiple)
instances of <i>IfcFlowTerminal</i>.</p>
<p><u><b>Property Set Use Definition</b></u>:</p>
<p>Note that there are no predefined property sets assigned to
this type at present. </p>
<p><u><b>Geometry Use Definitions</b></u></p>
<p>Representations of the type are defined as representation maps
(at the level of the supertype <i>IfcTypeProduct</i>).
These are assigned at the occurrence through the <i>IfcShapeRepresentation.Item</i>
being an <i>IfcMappedItem</i>.</p>
