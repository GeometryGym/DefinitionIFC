<p>The <i>IfcBuildingControlsDomain</i> schema forms
part of the Domain Layer of the IFC Model. It extends the ideas
concerning building services outlined in the <i>IfcSharedBldgServicesElements</i>
schema. It defines concepts of building automation, control,
instrumentation and alarm. </p>
<h3>Scope</h3>
<p>The <i>IfcBuildingControlsDomain</i> schema
supports ideas including types of: </p>
<ul>
  <li>actuator,</li>
  <li>alarm,</li>
  <li>controller,</li>
  <li>sensor,</li>
  <li>flow instrument ,</li>
</ul>
<p>Elements that perform the control action such as valves and
dampers are principally types of distribution element and are located
principally in the <i>IfcSharedBldgServicesElements</i>
schema</p>
<h3>Occurrence</h3>
<p>Classes within this schema define types of elements that are
used in building automation, control and instrumentation. They are
defined either as subtypes of <em>IfcTypeProduct</em> or
of other classes that are themselves subtypes of <em>IfcTypeProduct</em>.
</p>
<p>The objective is that a particular type of element is defined
once in an IFC exchange. Instances or occurrences of elements
conforming to a particular type are defined by instances of related
subtypes of <em>IfcDistributionElement</em>. The following
table sets down the class used for capturing the occurrence of a
particular element type within this schema:</p>
