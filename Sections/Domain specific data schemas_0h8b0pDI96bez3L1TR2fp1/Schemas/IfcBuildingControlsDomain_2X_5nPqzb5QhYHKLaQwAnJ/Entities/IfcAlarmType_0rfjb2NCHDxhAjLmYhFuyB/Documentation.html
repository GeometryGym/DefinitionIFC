<p><u><b>Use Definitions</b></u></p>
<p>An <i>IfcAlarmType</i> may be included into the
spatial context of the building model through an (or multiple)
instances of <i>IfcDistributionControlElement</i>.</p>
<p>Usage of <i>IfcAlarmType</i> defines the
parameters for one or more occurrences of <i>IfcDistributionControlElement</i>.</p>
<p>Alarm types include the provision of break glass buttons and
manual pull boxes that are used to activate alarms. These should be
used for alarms rather than a 'user defined' type of <i>IfcSwitchingDevice</i>.</p>
<p><u><b>Property Set Use Definition</b></u>:</p>
<p>There are no predefined property sets for <em>IfcAlarmType</em>

<p><u><b>Geometry Use Definitions</b></u></p>
<p>Representations of the type are defined as representation maps
(at the level of the supertype <i>IfcTypeProduct</i>).
These are assigned at the occurrence through the <i>IfcShapeRepresentation.Item</i>
being an <i>IfcMappedItem</i>.</p>
