	<p><u><b>Definition from IAI</b></u>: 
    The element type <i>IfcDuctFittingType</i> defines a list of commonly shared property
	set definitions of a duct fitting and an optional set of product representations.
	It is used to define an duct fitting specification (i.e. the specific product
	information, that is common to all occurrences of that product type).</p> 
	 
	<blockquote>
		<font size="-1">
		NOTE: The product representations are defined as
		representation maps (at the level of the supertype <i>IfcTypeProduct</i>, which
		get assigned by an element occurrence instance through the
		<i>IfcShapeRepresentation.Item[1]</i> being an
		<i>IfcMappedItem</i>.

    </blockquote>
    
    <p>A Duct fitting type is used to define the common properties of a
	duct fitting that may be applied to many occurrences of that type.
	A duct fitting is a junction or transition in a flow distribution system 
    (e.g., elbow, tee, etc.). Duct fitting types (or the instantiable subtypes) may be exchanged 
    without being already assigned to occurrences.</p> 
	
    <p>The occurrences of the <i>IfcDuctFittingType</i> are represented
	by instances of <i>IfcFlowFitting</i> or its subtypes.</p>
