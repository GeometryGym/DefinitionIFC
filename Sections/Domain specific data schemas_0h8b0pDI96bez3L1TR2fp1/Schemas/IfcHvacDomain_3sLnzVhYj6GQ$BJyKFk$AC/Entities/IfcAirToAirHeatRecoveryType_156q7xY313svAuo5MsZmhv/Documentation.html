	<p><u><b>Definition from IAI</b></u>: 
    The element type <i>IfcAirToAirHeatRecoveryType</i> defines a list of commonly shared property
	set definitions of an air-to-air heat recovery device and an optional set of product representations.
	It is used to define an air-to-air heat recovery device specification (i.e. the specific product
	information, that is common to all occurrences of that product type).</p> 
	 
	<blockquote>
		<font size="-1">
		NOTE: The product representations are defined as
		representation maps (at the level of the supertype <i>IfcTypeProduct</i>, which
		get assigned by an element occurrence instance through the
		<i>IfcShapeRepresentation.Item[1]</i> being an
		<i>IfcMappedItem</i>.

    <p>An air-to-air heat recovery type is used to define the common properties of an
	air-to-air heat recovery device that may be applied to many occurrences of that type. An
	air-to-air heat recovery device is typically used to transfer heat from warmer 
	air in one chamber to cooler air in the second chamber (i.e., typically used to recover heat 
	from the conditioned air being exhausted and the outside air being supplied to a building).
    Air-to-air heat recovery types may be exchanged 
    without being already assigned to occurrences.</p> 
	
    <p>The occurrences of the <i>IfcAirToAirHeatRecoveryType</i> are represented
	by instances of <i>IfcEnergyConversionDevice</i> or its subtypes.</p>
