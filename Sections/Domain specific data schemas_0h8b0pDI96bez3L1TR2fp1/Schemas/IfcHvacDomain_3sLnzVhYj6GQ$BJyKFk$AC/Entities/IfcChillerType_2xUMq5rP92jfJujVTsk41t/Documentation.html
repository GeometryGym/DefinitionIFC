	<p><u><b>Definition from IAI</b></u>: 
    The element type <i>IfcChillerType</i> defines a list of commonly shared property
	set definitions of a chiller and an optional set of product representations.
	It is used to define a chiller specification (i.e. the specific product
	information, that is common to all occurrences of that product type).</p> 
	 
	<blockquote>
		<font size="-1">
		NOTE: The product representations are defined as
		representation maps (at the level of the supertype <i>IfcTypeProduct</i>, which
		get assigned by an element occurrence instance through the
		<i>IfcShapeRepresentation.Item[1]</i> being an
		<i>IfcMappedItem</i>.

    <p>A chiller type is used to define the common properties of a
	chiller that may be applied to many occurrences of that type.
	A chiller is a device used to implement a refrigeration cycle for cooling a fluid, typically water or a mixture of water and glycol. The chilled water is then used to cool and dehumidify air in a building. 
    Chiller types may be exchanged 
    without being already assigned to occurrences.</p> 
	
    <p>The occurrences of the <i>IfcChillerType</i> are represented
	by instances of <i>IfcEnergyConversionDevice</i> or its subtypes.</p>
