	<p><u><b>Definition from IAI</b></u>: 
    The element type <i>IfcSpaceHeaterType</i> defines a list of commonly shared property
	set definitions of a space heater and an optional set of product representations.
	It is used to define a space heater specification (i.e. the specific product
	information, that is common to all occurrences of that product type).</p>

    <p>A space heater type is used to define the common properties of a
	space heater device that may be applied to many occurrences of that type.
    Space heaters utilize a combination of radiation and/or natural convection
    using a heating source such as steam or hot water. Examples of 
    space heaters include radiators, convectors, baseboard and finned-tube heaters, etc.
	Space heater types (or the instantiable subtypes) may be exchanged 
    without being already assigned to occurrences.</p> 
	
    <p>The occurrences of the <i>IfcSpaceHeaterType</i> are represented
	by instances of <i>IfcEnergyConversionDevice</i> or its subtypes.</p>
