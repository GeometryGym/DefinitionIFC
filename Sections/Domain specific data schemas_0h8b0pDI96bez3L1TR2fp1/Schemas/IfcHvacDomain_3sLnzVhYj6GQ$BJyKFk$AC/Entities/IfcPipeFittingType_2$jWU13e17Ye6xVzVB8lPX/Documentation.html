	<p><u><b>Definition from IAI</b></u>: 
    The element type <i>IfcPipeFittingType</i> defines a list of commonly shared property
	set definitions of a pipe fitting and an optional set of product representations.
	It is used to define a pipe fitting specification (i.e. the specific product
	information, that is common to all occurrences of that product type).</p> 
	 
	<blockquote>
		<font size="-1">
		NOTE: The product representations are defined as
		representation maps (at the level of the supertype <i>IfcTypeProduct</i>, which
		get assigned by an element occurrence instance through the
		<i>IfcShapeRepresentation.Item[1]</i> being an
		<i>IfcMappedItem</i>.

    </blockquote>
    
    <p>A pipe fitting type is used to define the common properties of a
	Pipe fitting that may be applied to many occurrences of that type.
	A pipe fitting is a junction or transition in a flow distribution system 
    (e.g., elbow, tee, etc.). Pipe fitting types (or the instantiable subtypes) may be exchanged 
    without being already assigned to occurrences.</p> 
	
    <p>The occurrences of the <i>IfcPipeFittingType</i> are represented
	by instances of <i>IfcFlowFitting</i> or its subtypes.</p>
