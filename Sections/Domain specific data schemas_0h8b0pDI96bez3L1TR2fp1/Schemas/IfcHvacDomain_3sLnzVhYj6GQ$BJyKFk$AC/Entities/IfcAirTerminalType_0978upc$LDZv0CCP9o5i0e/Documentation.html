	<p><u><b>Definition from IAI</b></u>: 
    The element type <i>IfcAirTerminalType</i> defines a list of commonly shared property
	set definitions of an air terminal and an optional set of product representations.
	It is used to define an air terminal specification (i.e. the specific product
	information, that is common to all occurrences of that product type).</p> 
	 
	An air terminal is a terminating or origination point for the
    transfer of air between distribution system(s) and one or more spaces.
    It can also be used for the transfer of air between adjacent spaces.

	<blockquote>

		NOTE: The product representations are defined as
		representation maps (at the level of the supertype <i>IfcTypeProduct</i>, which
		get assigned by an element occurrence instance through the
		<i>IfcShapeRepresentation.Item[1]</i> being an
		<i>IfcMappedItem</i>.

    <p>A air terminal type is used to define the common properties of a
	air terminal that may be applied to many occurrences of that type.
 An air terminal is a mechanical device used to control the characteristics air at the entrance or exit to an open system, such as a room or space. 
	Air terminal types (or the instantiable subtypes) may be exchanged 
    without being already assigned to occurrences.</p> 
	
    <p>The occurrences of the <i>IfcAirTerminalType</i> are represented
	by instances of <i>IfcFlowTerminal</i> or its subtypes.</p>
