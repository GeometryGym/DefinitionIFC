	<p><u><b>Definition from IAI</b></u>: 
	This enumeration identifies different types of air terminal boxes. </p>  
     
    <p>Valid enumerations are:</p>
	<ul> 
		<li><b>CONSTANTFLOW</b>:  Terminal box does not include a means to reset the volume automatically to an outside signal such as thermostat.</li>
		<li><b>VARIABLEFLOWPRESSUREDEPENDANT</b>:  terminal box includes a means to reset the volume automatically to a different control point in response to an outside signal such as thermostat: air-flow rate depends on supply pressure.</li>
		<li><b>VARIABLEFLOWPRESSUREINDEPENDANT</b>:  terminal box includes a means to reset the volume automatically to a different control point in response to an outside signal such as thermostat: air-flow rate is independant of supply pressure.</li>
		<li><b>USERDEFINED</b>:				  User-defined terminal box.</li>
		<li><b>NOTDEFINED</b>:					  Undefined terminal box.</li>
   	</ul>
