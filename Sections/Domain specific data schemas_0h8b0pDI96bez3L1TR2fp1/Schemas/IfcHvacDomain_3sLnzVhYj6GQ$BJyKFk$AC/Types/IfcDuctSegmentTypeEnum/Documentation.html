	<p><u><b>Definition from IAI</b></u>: 
	This enumeration is used to identify the primary purpose of a
    duct segment. This is a very basic categorization mechanism
    to generically identify the duct segment type. Subcategories
    of duct segments are not enumerated. 
    The <i>IfcDuctSegmentTypeEnum</i> contains the following:</p>
	<ul> 
		<li><b>RIGIDSEGMENT</b>: A rigid segment is continuous linear segment of duct
                                 that cannot be deformed.</li>
		<li><b>FLEXIBLESEGMENT</b>:  A flexible segment is a continuous non-linear segment
                                     of duct that can be deformed and change the direction 
                                     of flow.</li>
		<li><b>USERDEFINED</b>: User-defined segment.</li>
		<li><b>NOTDEFINED</b>:  Undefined segment.</li>
	</ul>
