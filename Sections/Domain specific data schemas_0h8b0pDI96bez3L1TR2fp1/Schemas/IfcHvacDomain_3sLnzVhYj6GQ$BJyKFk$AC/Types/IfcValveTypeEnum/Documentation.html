	<p><u><b>Definition from IAI</b></u>: The <i>IfcValveTypeEnum</i> defines the
	range of different types of valve that can be specified. These are typically
       used in conjunction with Pset_ValveTypeCommon, which contains common
	properties for all valve types. The <i>IfcValveTypeEnum</i> contains:</p>
	<ul> 
	  <li><b>AIRRELEASE</b>: Valve used to release air from a pipe or fitting. </li> 
	  <li><b>ANTIVACUUM</b>: Valve that opens to admit air if the pressure falls below
		 atmospheric pressure (BS6100 330 4104)</li> 
	  <li><b>CHANGEOVER</b>: Valve that enables flow to be switched between pipelines (3 or 4
		 port).</li> 
	  <li><b>CHECK</b>: Valve that permits water to flow in one direction only and is
		 enclosed when there is no flow (2 port).</li> 
	  <li><b>COMMISSIONING</b>: Valve used to facilitate commissioning of a system (2 port).</li> 
	  <li><b>DIVERTING</b>: Valve that enables flow to be diverted from one branch of a
		 pipeline to another (3 port).</li> 
	  <li><b>DOUBLECHECK</b>: An assembly that incorporates two valves used to prevent backflow
		 (BS6100 330 4106).</li> 
	  <li><b>DOUBLEREGULATING</b>: Valve used to facilitate regulation of fluid flow in a system.</li>
	  <li><b>DRAWOFFCOCK</b>: A valve used to remove fluid from a piping system.</li>
	  <li><b>FAUCET</b>: Faucet valve typically used as a flow discharge.</li>
	  <li><b>FLUSHING</b>: Valve that flushes a predetermined quantity of water to cleanse a
		 toilet, urinal, etc.</li>
	  <li><b>GASCOCK</b>: Valve that is used for controlling the flow of gas.</li> 
	  <li><b>GASTAP</b>: Gas tap typically used for venting or discharging gas from a system.</li>
	  <li><b>ISOLATING</b>: Valve that closes off flow in a pipeline.</li> 
	  <li><b>MIXING</b>: Valve that enables flow from two branches of a pipeline to be mixed
		 together (3 port).</li> 
	  <li><b>PRESSUREREDUCING</b>: Valve that reduces the pressure of a fluid immediately downstream
		 of its position in a pipeline to a preselected value or by a predetermined
		 ratio.</li> 
	  <li><b>PRESSURERELIEF</b>: Spring or weight loaded valve that automatically discharges to a
		 safe place fluid that has built up to excessive pressure in pipes or
		 fittings</li> 
	  <li><b>REGULATING</b>: Valve used to facilitate regulation of fluid flow in a system.</li>
	  <li><b>SAFETYCUTOFF</b>: Valve that closes under the action of a safety mechanism such as a
		 drop weight, solenoid etc.</li> 
	  <li><b>STEAMTRAP</b>: Valve that restricts flow of steam while allowing condensate to 
            pass through.</li> 
	  <li><b>STOPCOCK</b>: An isolating valve used on a domestic water service.</li> 
	  <li><b>USERDEFINED</b>: User-defined valve type.</li> 
	  <li><b>NOTDEFINED</b>: Undefined valve type.</li> 
    </ul>
