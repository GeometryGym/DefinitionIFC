	<p><u><b>Definition from IAI</b></u>: 
	Types of compressors.
    The <i>IfcCompressorTypeEnum</i> contains the following:</p>
	<ul> 
		<li><b>DYNAMIC</b>: The pressure of refrigerant vapor is increased by a continuous transfer of angular momentum from a rotating member to the vapor followed by conversion of this momentum into static pressure.</li>
		<li><b>RECIPROCATING</b>: Positive-displacement compressor using a piston driven by a connecting rod from a crankshaft.</li>
		<li><b>ROTARY</b>: Positive-displacement compressor using a roller or rotor device.</li>
		<li><b>SCROLL</b>: Positive-displacement compressor using two inter-fitting, spiral-shaped scroll members.</li>
		<li><b>TROCHOIDAL</b>: Positive-displacement compressor using a rolling motion of one circle outside or inside the circumference of a basic circle and produce either epitrochoids or hypotrochoids.</li>
		<li><b>SINGLESTAGE</b>: Positive-displacement reciprocating compressor where vapor is compressed in a single stage.</li>
		<li><b>BOOSTER</b>: Positive-displacement reciprocating compressor where pressure is increased by a booster.</li>
		<li><b>OPENTYPE</b>: Positive-displacement reciprocating compressor where the shaft extends through a seal in the crankcase for an external drive.</li>
		<li><b>HERMETIC</b>: Positive-displacement reciprocating compressor where the motor and compressor are contained within the same housing, with the motor shaft integral with the compressor crankshaft and the motor in contact with refrigerant.</li>
		<li><b>SEMIHERMETIC</b>: Positive-displacement reciprocating compressor where the hermetic compressors use bolted construction amenable to field repair.</li>
		<li><b>WELDEDSHELLHERMETIC</b>: Positive-displacement reciprocating compressor where the motor compressor is mounted inside a steel shell, which, in turn is sealed by welding.</li>
		<li><b>ROLLINGPISTON</b>: Positive-displacement rotary compressor using a roller mounted on the eccentric of a shaft with a single vane in the nonrotating cylindrical housing.</li>
		<li><b>ROTARYVANE</b>: Positive-displacement rotary compressor using a roller mounted on the eccentric of a shaft with multiple vanes in the nontotating cylindrical housing.</li>
		<li><b>SINGLESCREW</b>: Positive-displacement rotary compressor using a single cylindrical main rotor that works with a pair of gate rotors.</li>
		<li><b>TWINSCREW</b>: Positive-displacement rotary compressor using two mating helically grooved rotors, male (lobes) and female (flutes) in a stationary housing with inlet and outlet gas ports.</li>
 		<li><b>USERDEFINED</b>: User-defined compressor type.</li>
		<li><b>NOTDEFINED</b>:  Undefined compressor type.</li>
