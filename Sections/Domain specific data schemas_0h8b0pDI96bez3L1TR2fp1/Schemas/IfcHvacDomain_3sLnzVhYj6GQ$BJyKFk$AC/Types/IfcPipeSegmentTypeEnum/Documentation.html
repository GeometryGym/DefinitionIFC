	<p><u><b>Definition from IAI</b></u>: 
	This enumeration is used to identify the primary purpose of a
    pipe segment. This is a very basic categorization mechanism
    to generically identify the pipe segment type. Subcategories
    of pipe segments are not enumerated. 
    The <i>IfcPipeSegmentTypeEnum</i> contains the following:</p>
	<ul> 
		<li><b>RIGIDSEGMENT</b>: A rigid segment is continuous linear segment of pipe
                                 that cannot be deformed.</li>
		<li><b>FLEXIBLESEGMENT</b>:  A flexible segment is a continuous non-linear segment
                                     of pipe that can be deformed and change the direction
                                     of flow.</li>
		<li><b>GUTTER</b>: A gutter segment is a continuous open-channel segment of pipe.</li>
		<li><b>SPOOL</b>: A type of rigid segment that is typically shorter and used for 
                          providing connectivity within a piping network.</li>
		<li><b>USERDEFINED</b>: User-defined segment.</li>
		<li><b>NOTDEFINED</b>:  Undefined segment.</li>
	</ul>
