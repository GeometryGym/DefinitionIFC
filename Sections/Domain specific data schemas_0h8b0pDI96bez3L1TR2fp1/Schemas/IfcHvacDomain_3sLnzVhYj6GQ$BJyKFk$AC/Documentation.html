<EPM-HTML> 
	<p>The <i>IfcHvacDomain</i> schema in the domain layer defines basic object 
    concepts required for interoperability within the heating, ventilating and
    air conditioning (HVAC) domain. It extends concepts defined in the <i>IfcSharedBldgServiceElements</i> 
schema.</p>

<h3>Scope</h3>

<p>The scope of the <i>IfcHvacDomain</i> schema is defined as:</p>


<ol> 
<li>The segments, fittings and connections that constitute duct and piping distribution systems typically 
used for building services, such as for air conditioning, ventilation and exhaust-air systems; chilled water, 
steam and heating hot water, potable water, waste, natural gas and LPG systems, etc.</li> 
<li>Equipment typically used in building services systems, such as boilers, chillers, fans, pumps, etc., and 
the vibration isolation associated with these components.</li>
<li>Terminal and flow control devices, such as air vents and grilles, variable air volume modulators, valves, 
dampers, etc.</li> 
</ol> 


<h3>Out of Scope</h3>
<p>The following are deemed to be out of scope of the <i>IfcHvacDomain</i> schema at this time:</p> 

<ul>
<li>Industrial and institutional specialty equipment such as that used for power production, manufacturing 
and fabrication, etc.</li>
<li>Provisions for dealing explicitly with hazardous materials such as chemical or biological agents</li>
<li>Controls systems and sequencing systems for these equipment beyond what is defined in the 
<i>IfcBuildingControl</i> domain schema</li>
</ul>

<h3>Occurrence</h3> 

<p>Classes within this schema define only types of elements that are used in heating, ventilating and air 
conditioning building services where subtypes of <i>IfcDistributionElementType</i> have been elaborated in 
the <i>IfcSharedBldgServiceElements</i> schema to mirror their corresponding occurrence entities. Refer to 
the schema description for the <i>IfcSharedBldgServiceElements</i> for more information about concepts of 
type, occurrence and performance history.</p>

<p>The objective is that a specific element type is defined only once in an IFC exchange. Occurrences of 
elements that are related to these types are defined by instances of related subtypes of 
<i>IfcDistributionElement</i> (also defined in the <i>IfcSharedBldgServiceElements</i> schema). Details of 
the relevant occurrence subtype are provided in the documentation for each type. </p>
