<P>
   The schema <I>IfcStructuralElementsDomain</I> provides the ability to
   represent different kinds of building elements and building element
   parts which in general are of structural nature. In addition to generally 
   used building elements already defined in the <I>IfcSharedBuildingElements</I>
   schema, the schema contains entities for representing foundation parts, such as
   footings and piles, as well as some important structural subparts included in other
   building elements, such as different kinds of explicit reinforcement parts, plates 
   belonging to structural members and other major parts. The schema also includes a
   class (<I>IfcReinforcementDefinitionProperties</I>) for defining reinforcement
   requirement properties.
