	 <UL> 
		<LI><B>FOOTING_BEAM</B> Footing elements that are in bending and are
		  supported clear of the ground. They will normally span between piers, piles or
		  pile caps. They are distinguished from beams in the building superstructure
		  since they will normally require a lower grade of finish. They are
		  distinguished from <I>STRIP_FOOTING</I> since they are clear of the ground
		  surface and hence require support to the lower face while the concrete is
		  curing. </LI>
		<LI><B>PAD_FOOTING</B> An element that transfers the load of a single
		  column (possibly two) to the ground. </LI>
		<LI><B>PILE_CAP</B> An element that transfers the load from a column or
		  group of columns to a pier or pile or group of piers or piles. </LI>
		<LI><B>STRIP_FOOTING</B> A linear element that transfers loads into the
		  ground from either a continuous element, such as a wall, or from a series of
		  elements, such as columns. </LI>
		<LI><B>USERDEFINED</B> Special types of footings which meet specific
		  local requirements. </LI>
		<LI><B>NOTDEFINED</B> The type of footing is not defined. </LI>
