	 <P> <U>Definition from IAI:</U> A building element component represents
		items included in building elements, which usually are not of interest from the
		overall building structure viewpoint. Contrary to accessories these components
		form a significant part of the building elements they belong to and usually
		have a vital and load carrying function within the structure. Typical examples
		of <I>IfcBuildingElementComponent</I>s include different kinds of reinforcing
		elements, layers of sandwich wall panels, and plates as parts of structural
		members. </P>

	 <P><B>Geometry Use Definitions:</B></P> 
	 <P> The geometric representation of <I>IfcBuildingElementComponent</I> is
		given by the <I>IfcProductDefinitionShape</I>, allowing multiple geometric
		representations. Included are: </P> 
	 <P><U>Local Placement</U><BR> The local placement for
		<I>IfcBuildingElementComponent</I> is defined in its supertype
		<I>IfcProduct</I>. It is defined by the <I>IfcLocalPlacement</I>, which defines
		the local coordinate system that is referenced by all geometric
		representations. </P> 
	 <UL> 
		<LI>The <I>PlacementRelTo</I> relationship of <I>IfcLocalPlacement</I>
		  shall point (if given) to the local placement of the same
		  <I>IfcBuildingElement</I> or <I>IfcElementAssembly</I>, which is used in the
		  <I>Decomposes</I> inverse attribute, i.e. the local placement is defined
		  relative to the local placement of the building element or element assembly in
		  which the component is contained. </LI>
		<LI>If the relative placement is not used, the absolute placement is
		  defined within the world coordinate system. </LI>
	 </UL>
	 <P><U>SurfaceModel Representation</U><BR> Any
		<I>IfcBuildingElementComponent</I> (if no further constraints are defined at
		the level of its subtypes) may be represented as a single or multiple surface
		models, based on either shell or face based models. It is ensured by assigning
		the value 'SurfaceModel' to the <I>RepresentationType</I> attribute of
		<I>IfcShapeRepresentation</I>. In some cases it may be useful to also expose a
		simple representation as a bounding box representation of the same complex
		shape. </P> 
	 <P><U>Brep Representation</U><BR> Any <I>IfcBuildingElementComponent</I>
		(if no further constraints are defined at the level of its subtypes) may be
		represented as a single or multiple Boundary Representation elements (which are
		restricted to faceted Brep with or without voids). The Brep representation
		allows for the representation of complex element shape. It is ensured by
		assigning the value 'Brep' to the <I>RepresentationType</I> attribute of
		<I>IfcShapeRepresentation</I>. In some cases it may be useful to also expose a
		simple representation as a bounding box representation of the same complex
		shape. </P> 
	 <P><U>MappedRepresentation</U><BR> The mapped item, <I>IfcMappedItem</I>,
		should be used if appropriate as it allows for reusing the geometry definition
		of the equipment type at occurrences of the same equipment type. In this case
		the <I>IfcShapeRepresentation.RepresentationType</I> = 'MappedRepresentation'
		is used. </P>
