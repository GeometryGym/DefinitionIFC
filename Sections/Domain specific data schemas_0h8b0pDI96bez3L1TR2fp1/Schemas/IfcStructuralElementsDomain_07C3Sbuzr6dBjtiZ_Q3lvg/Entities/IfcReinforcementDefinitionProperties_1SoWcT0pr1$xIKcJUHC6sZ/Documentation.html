	 <P> <U>Definition from IAI:</U> An
		<I>IfcReinforcementDefinitionProperties</I> defines the cross section
		properties of reinforcement included in reinforced concrete building elements.
		The property set definition may be used both in conjunction with insitu and
		precast structures. </P>

	 <P><B>General usage:</B></P> 
	 <P> This subtype of <I>IfcPropertySetDefinition</I> is used to define the
		reinforcement properties in early design stages, such as in requirement
		definition or scheme design. In later design stages explicit instances of
		subtypes of <I>IfcReinforcingElement</I> are used. The intended usage may be
		indicated using the <I>DefinitionType</I> attribute value as a designator:
		recommended values are 'Reinforcement area requirement' or 'Reinforcement
		configuration requirement'. Other values may be used according to local
		standards. </P> 
	 <P> Only one property set definition of this kind is used for each concrete
		building element in each intended usage indicated by the <I>DefinitionType</I>
		attribute value. This set then defines a list of cross section properties in a
		discrete number of longitudinal sections as instances of
		<I>IfcSectionReinforcementProperties</I> (one for each structural reinforcement
		bar role), which in turn have a section cross section property defined as a
		profile and a number of reinforcement properties, one for each steel grade /
		bar type. </P>
