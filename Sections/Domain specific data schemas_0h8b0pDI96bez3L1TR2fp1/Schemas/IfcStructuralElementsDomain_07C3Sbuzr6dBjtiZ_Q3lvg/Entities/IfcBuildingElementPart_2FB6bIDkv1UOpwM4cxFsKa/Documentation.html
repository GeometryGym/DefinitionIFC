<p><u>Definition from IAI:</u> Layers or major
components as subordinate
parts of a building element. Typical usage examples include precast
concrete
sandwich walls, where the layers may have different geometry
representations.
In this case the layered material representation does not sufficiently
describe
the element. Each layer is represented by an own instance of the
<i>IfcBuildingElementPart</i> with its own geometry
description. </p>

<p><u><b>Property Set Use Definition</b></u>:</p>
<p>The property sets relating to the <i>IfcBuildingElementPart</i>
are defined by the
<i>IfcPropertySet</i> and attached by the <i>IfcRelDefinesByProperties</i>
relationship. It is accessible by the inverse <i>IsDefinedBy</i>
relationship.
The following property set definitions specific to the <i>IfcBuildingElementPart</i>
are part
of this IFC release:</p>
<ul>
  <li><a
 href="../../psd/IfcStructuralElementsDomain/Pset_ConcreteElementSurfaceFinishQuantityGeneral.xml"
 target="SOURCE">Pset_ConcreteElementSurfaceFinishQuantityGeneral</a>:
common property set for all <i>IfcBuildingElementPart</i>
occurrences related to concrete construction.
(Note: this is a general property set, which relates to many IFC
classes, e.g. subtypes of <i>IfcBuildingElement</i>). </li>

<p><b>Geometry Use Definitions:</b></p>
<p> The geometric representation of <i>IfcBuildingElementPart</i>
is given
by the <i>IfcProductDefinitionShape</i>, allowing multiple
geometric
representations. Included are: </p>
<p><u>Local Placement</u><br>
The use of local placement is defined at the
supertype <i>IfcBuildingElementComponent</i>. </p>
<p><u>Standard Geometric Representation</u><br>
The use of Standard
Geometric Representations is defined at the supertype
<i>IfcBuildingElementComponent</i>. </p>
