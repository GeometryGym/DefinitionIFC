	 <P><U>Definition from IAI</U>: Architectural program for a space in the
		building or facility being designed; essentially the requirements definition
		for such a building space. </P> 
	 <BLOCKQUOTE> <FONT SIZE="-1">NOTE: that this 'program' defines the client
		requirements for the space before the building is designed. Space programs can
		change over the life cycle of a building, after the building is occupied.
		Changes to space programs take place in the facilities management/operations

	 <P>The assignment of a person or an organization to a space program, e.g.,
		as the anticipated occupants of the space, is handled through using the
		objectified relationship <I>IfcRelAssignsToActor</I> referring to
		<I>IfcActor</I>. Space programs can be nested, i.e. an IfcSpaceProgram can
		specify a program group up to any desired level. This is handled through using
		the objectified relationship <I>IfcRelNests</I>.</P> 
	 <P><U><B>Property Set Use Definition</B></U>:</P> 
	 <P>The property sets relating to the <I>IfcSpaceProgram</I> are defined by
		the <I>IfcPropertySet</I> and attached by the <I>IfcRelDefinesByProperties</I>
		relationship. It is accessible by the inverse <I>IsDefinedBy</I> relationship.
		The following property set definitions specific to the <I>IfcSpaceProgram</I>
		are part of this IFC release:</P> 
	 <UL> 
		<LI><A HREF="../../psd/IfcArchitectureDomain/Pset_SpaceProgramCommon.xml"
		  TARGET="SOURCE">Pset_SpaceProgramCommon</A>: common property set for all types
		  of the space program</LI> 
	 </UL>
	 <P><B><U>General Use Definition</U></B></P> 
	 <P>The <I>IfcSpaceProgram</I> entity is used to define: </P> 
	 <UL> 
		<LI>the architectural program for a space in the building or facility
		  being designed; </LI> 
		<LI>the standard for space allocation that can be assigned to persons
		  within an organization. </LI> 
	 </UL> 
	 <P>As the architectural program, the <I>IfcSpaceProgram</I> class sets down
		the requirements definition for a space in the building or facility being
		designed. Used in this way, it defines the client requirements for the space
		before the building in designed. Space programs can change over the life cycle
		of a building, after the building is occupied. Changes to space programs take
		place in the facilities management/operations phase of the building life cycle.
		</P> 
	 <P>As a space standard for facilities management (FM), the
		<I>IfcSpaceProgram</I> class defines the requirements for usage of a space
		according to the roles of persons that will occupy the space. This could take
		into account role driven elements such as whether the space should be a single
		person office, corner space, glazing on two sides etc. In order to use the
		class as an space standard within FM, a classification of spaces must have been
		established. This does not mean that each individual space needs to have a
		classification although for locating persons having an assigned space standard,
		this would be desirable.</P>
