	 <P><U>Definition from BS 6100</U>: A permeable covering is a permeable
		cover for an opening which allows airflow . </P> 
	 <P><U>Definition from IAI</U>: A description of a panel within a door or
		window (as fillers for opening) which allows for air flow. It is given by its
		properties (<I>IfcPermeableCoveringProperties</I>). A permeable covering is a
		casement, i.e. a component, fixed or opening, consisting essentially of a frame
		and the infilling. The infilling is normally a grill, a louver or a screen. The
		way of operation is defined in the operation type. </P> 
	 <P>The <I>IfcPermeableCoveringProperties</I> are included in the list of
		properties (<I>HasPropertySets</I>) of the <I>IfcWindowStyle</I> or the
		<I>IfcDoorStyle</I>. More information about the permeable covering can be
		included in the same list of the window or door style using the
		<I>IfcPropertySet</I> for dynamic extensions. This particularly applies for
		additional properties for the various operation types</P>

	 <P>The <I>IfcPermeableCoveringProperties</I> does not hold an own geometric
		representation. However it defines parameter, which can be used to create the
		shape of the <I>IfcWindowStyle</I> (which is inserted by the <I>IfcWindow</I>
		into the spatial context of the project), or of the <I>IfcDoorStyle</I> (which
		is inserted by the <I>IfcDoor</I>).</P> 
	 <P><B>Interpretation of parameter</B></P> 
	 <P>The parameters at the <I>IfcPermeableCoveringProperties</I> define a
		standard permeable covering. The outer boundary of the panel is determined by
		the occurrence parameter assigned to the <I>IfcWindow</I> or <I>IfcDoor</I>. It
		has to take the lining parameter into account as well. The position of the
		permeable covering within the overall window or door is determined by the
		<I>PanelPosition</I> attribute.</P>
