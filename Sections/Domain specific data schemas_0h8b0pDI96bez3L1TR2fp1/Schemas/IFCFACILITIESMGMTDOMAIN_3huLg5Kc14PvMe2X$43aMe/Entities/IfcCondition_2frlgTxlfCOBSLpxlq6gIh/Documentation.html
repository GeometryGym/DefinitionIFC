	 <P><I>IfcCondition</I> is a particular subtype of <I>IfcGroup</I> that can
		contain only instances of <I>IfcConditionCriterion</I>. The objectified
		relationship class <I>IfcRelAssignsToGroup</I> is used to assign the related
		instances of <I>IfcConditionCriterion</I> to the relating instance of
		<I>IfcCondition</I>. </P> 
	 <P>An <I>IfcCondition</I> is determined either from an observed or a
		measured state (see <I>IfcConditionCriterion</I>). The condition is determined
		at a particular point in time, the time being determined through the
		<I>IfcRelAssociatesDateTime</I> class with an appropriate designation for the
		value of the DateTimeType e.g. AssessmentDate. Note that other dates may be
		assigned to <I>IfcCondition</I> for relevant purposes e.g. to recommend the
		date for the next condition assessment.</P> 
	 <P><I>IfcRelAssignsToProduct</I> is used to relate one or more instances of
		<I>IfcCondition</I> to an artifact that is an instance of a subtype of
		<I>IfcProduct</I>. For an instance of <I>IfcAsset</I>, condition is related
		through the use of <I>IfcRelAssignsToGroup</I>.</P>
