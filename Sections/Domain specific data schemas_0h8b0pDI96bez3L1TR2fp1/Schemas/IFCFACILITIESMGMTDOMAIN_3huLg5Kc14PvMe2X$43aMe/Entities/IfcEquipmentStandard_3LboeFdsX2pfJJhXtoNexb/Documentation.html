	 <P>An <I>IfcEquipmentStandard</I> is assigned a set of classification
		notations (through the <I>IfcRelAssociatesClassification</I> class within the
		<I>IfcKernel</I> schema) that determine the types of equipment that fulfill the
		requirements of the standard. In order to use the equipment standard class, a
		classification of equipment items must have been established. This does not
		mean that each individual equipment item needs to have a classification
		notation although this is considered to be desirable. Examples of equipment
		items that might fall within an equipment standard include number and type PC's
		and connections, task lighting, pictures etc. </P>
	 <P>An equipment standard is assigned to one or several persons or
		organizations (like a work group or department) through the
		<I>IfcRelAssignsToControl</I> relationship via the <I>Controls</I> inverse
		attribute.</P>
