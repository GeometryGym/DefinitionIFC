	 <P>An <I>IfcConditionCriterion</I> may be either an observed/assessed value
		or a measured value. This is determined by selection through the
		<I>IfcConditionCriterionSelect</I> type that has a datatype either of
		<I>IfcLabel</I> (for a numeric or alphanumeric scale observation e.g. on a
		scale of 1 to 10 where 1 represents 'as new' and 10 represents 'urgent
		replacement required') or of <I>IfcMeasureWithUnit</I> (for a measured
		criterion that also includes units of measure).</P> 
	 <P>Each criterion must be named and optionally, may also have a
		description. A description used for a condition should be persistent so that
		there is absolute consistency in condition recording.</P>
