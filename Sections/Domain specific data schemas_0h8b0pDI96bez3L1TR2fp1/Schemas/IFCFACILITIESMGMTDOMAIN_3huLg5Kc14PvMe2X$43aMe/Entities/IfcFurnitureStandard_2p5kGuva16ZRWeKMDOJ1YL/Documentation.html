	 <P>A furniture standard is assigned a set of classification notations
		(through the <I>IfcRelAssociatesClassification</I> class within the
		<I>IfcKernel</I> schema) that determine the types of furniture that fulfill the
		requirements of the standard. In order to use the IfcFurnitureStandard class, a
		classification of furniture items must have been established. This does not
		mean that each individual furniture item needs to have a classification
		notation although this is considered to be desirable. </P>
	 <P>A furniture standard is assigned to one or several persons or
		organizations (like a work group or department) through the
		<I>IfcRelAssignsToControl</I> relationship via the <I>Controls</I> inverse
		attribute.</P>
