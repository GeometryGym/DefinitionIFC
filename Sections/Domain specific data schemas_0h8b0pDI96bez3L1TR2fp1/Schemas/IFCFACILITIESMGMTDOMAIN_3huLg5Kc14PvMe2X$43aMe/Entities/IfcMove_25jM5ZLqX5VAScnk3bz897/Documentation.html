	 <P><U>Definition from IAI</U>: An <I>IfcMove</I> is an activity that moves
		people, groups within an organization or complete organizations together with
		their associated furniture and equipment from one place to another. The objects
		to be moved, normally people, equipment, and furniture, are assigned by the
		<I>IfcRelAssignsToProcess</I> relationship.</P>

	 <P>Actors, equipment and furniture are moved from one
		IfcSpatialStructureElement to another. The IfcSpatialStructureElement to be
		moved from and that to be moved to are assigned to the IfcMove class using the
		IfcRelAssignsToProcess relationship. </P> 
	 <P>The actors (as <I>IfcActor</I>), equipment and furnitures to be moved
		are assigned to the <I>IfcMove</I> using the <I>IfcRelAssignsToProcess</I>
		relationship</P> 
	 <P>Each <I>IfcMove</I> must have a name. This requirement is enforced by a
		rule.</P> 
	 <P>The inherited attribute <I>OperatesOn</I> refers to the
		<I>IfcRelAssignsToProcess</I> relationship, keeping the reference to
		<I>IfcActor, IfcEquipmentElement </I>and<I> IfcFurnishingElement</I>. The
		<I>QuantityInProcess</I> attribute at the relationship object can be used to
		specify a quantity of the objects to be moved.</P>
	 <P>Constraints may be applied to a move through instances of the
		<I>IfcConstraint</I> class (or its subtypes) that are associated through the
		<I>IfcRelAssociatesConstraint</I> relationship class</P> 
	 <P>Moves can be nested, i.e. a move object can contain other (more
		detailed) move objects. This is handled by the <I>IfcRelNests</I> relationship
		pointing (with RelatingObject) to the containing move and (with RelatedObjects)
		to the contained (sub)moves.</P> 
	 <P>Moves are assigned to a move schedule (represented as
		<I>IfcWorkSchedule</I> with Purpose attribute '<I>Move</I>') by using the
		<I>IfcRelAssignsTask</I> relationship.</P>
