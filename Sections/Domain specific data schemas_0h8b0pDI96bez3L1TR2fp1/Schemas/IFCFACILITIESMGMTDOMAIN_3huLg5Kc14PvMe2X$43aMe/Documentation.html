<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>The <i>IfcFacilitiesMgmtDomain</i> Schema defines
basic concepts in the facilities management (FM) domain. Together with
the <i>IfcProcessExtension</i>, <i>IfcSharedMgmtElements</i>,
and <i>IfcSharedFacilitiesElements</i> schema, it provides
a set of models that can be used to exchange information between
facilities management applications. </p>
<h2>Scope</h2>
<p>The <i>IfcFacilitiesMgmtDomain</i> schema forms
part of the Domain Layer of the IFC Model. It extends the ideas
concerning facilities management outlined in the <i>IfcSharedFacilitiesElements</i>
schema and management in general outlined in the <i>IfcSharedMgmtElements</i>
schema. The objective is to capture information that supports specific
business processes that are wholly within the domain of interest of the
Facilities Manager. The aim is to provide support for information
exchange and sharing within computer aided facilities management and
computer aided maintenance management applications. The extent of the
model will not support the some of the more detailed ideas found in
these applications.</p>
<p>The following are within the scope of this part of the
specifications:</p>
<ul>
  <li> Managing the movement of people and their associated
equipment from one place to another. All types of move are considered
to be within scope ranging from moving a single person from one office
to another to the movement of complete organizations between locations.</li>
  <li> The assignment of facilities management standards
according to roles played by actors within an organization. Assignment
of standards is limited to space, furniture and equipment.</li>
  <li>Capturing information concerning the condition of
components and assets both for subjective and objective assessment of
condition.</li>
  <li> Recording the assignment of permits for access and
carrying out work.</li>
  <li> Capturing requests for action to be carried out and the
assignment of work orders to fulfill the needs expressed by requests.</li>
</ul>
<p>The following are outside of the scope of this part of the
specifications:</p>
<ul>
  <li> Work interactions between actors and between space
programs.</li>
  <li>Moving or identifying the movement of or identifying the
need for (as a result of moving) electrical or telecommunications
services or connection points or the need for new electrical or
telecommunications equipment as a result of the move.</li>
  <li>Facilities management standards other than space, furniture
and equipment.</li>
</ul>
