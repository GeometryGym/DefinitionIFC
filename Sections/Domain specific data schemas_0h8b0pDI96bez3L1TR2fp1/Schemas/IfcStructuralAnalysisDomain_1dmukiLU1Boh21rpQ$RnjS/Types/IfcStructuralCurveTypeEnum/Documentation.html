	 <P><U>Definition from IAI:</U> This type definition shall be used to

		distinguish between different types of structural 'curve' members, such as

		cables. The <I>IfcStructuralCurveTypeEnum</I> type is referenced by the entity

		<I>IfcStructuralCurveMember</I>. </P>

<ul>
<li><b>RIGID_JOINED_MEMBER</b>:  A member with capacity to carry transverse and axial loads, i.e. a beam. Its actual joints may be rigid or pinned. Typically used in rigid frames.</li>
<li><b>PIN_JOINED_MEMBER</b>:    A member with capacity to carry axial loads only, i.e. a link. Typically used in trusses.</li>
<li><b>CABLE</b>:                A tension member which is able to carry transverse loads only under large deflection.</li>
<li><b>TENSION_MEMBER</b>:       A member without compressional stiffness.</li>
<li><b>COMPRESSION_MEMBER</b>:   A member without tensional stiffness.</li>
<li><b>USERDEFINED</b>:          A specially defined member.</li>
<li><b>NOTDEFINED</b>:           A member without further categorization.</li>
</ul>
