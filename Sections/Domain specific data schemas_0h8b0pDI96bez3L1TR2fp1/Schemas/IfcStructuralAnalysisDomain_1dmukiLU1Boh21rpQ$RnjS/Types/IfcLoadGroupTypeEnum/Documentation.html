	 <P><U>Definition from IAI:</U> This type definition is used to distinguish
		between different kinds and purposes of load grouping. It allows to
		differentiate between load groups, load cases, load combination groups and load
		combinations. Normally, these enumeration types shall be used in the following
		context : </P> 
	 <UL> 
		<LI>LOAD_GROUP groups instances of <I>IfcStructuralAction</I> or its
		  subclasses. It shall be used as a container for loads grouped together for
		  specific purposes. Optionally, an overall load factor can be assigned. </LI> 
		<LI>LOAD_CASE groups LOAD_GROUPs and instances of
		  <I>IfcStructuralAction</I> or its subclasses. It shall be used as a container
		  for loads with the same origin, and to assign a common load factor. </LI> 
		<LI>LOAD_COMBINATION_GROUP shall be used to group LOAD_CASEs and to
		  assign a common load combination factor. The grouping of LOAD_GROUPs and
		  instances of <I>IfcStructuralAction</I> or its subclasses is also possible, but
		  off the traditional way. </LI> 
		<LI>LOAD_COMBINATION shall be used to group all loads belonging to a
		  specific load combination. Normally only LOAD_COMBINATION_GROUPs with all
		  needed load factors are used to create load combinations. </LI> 
	 </UL> 
	 <P>The <I>IfcLoadGroupTypeEnum</I> type is referenced by the entity
		<I>IfcStructuralLoadGroup</I>. </P>
