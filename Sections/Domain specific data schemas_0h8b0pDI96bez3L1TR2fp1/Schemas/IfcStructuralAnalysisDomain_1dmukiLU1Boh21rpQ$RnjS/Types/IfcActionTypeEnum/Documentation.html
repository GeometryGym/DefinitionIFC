	 <P><U>Definition from IAI:</U> This enumeration type is used to distinguish
		between possible action types at a high level. It can be used for an automated
		definition of load combinations and for dimensioning. The contained items and
		their acronyms are adopted from the Eurocode standard. </P>
	 <P>The <I>IfcActionTypeEnum</I> type is referenced by the entity
		<I>IfcStructuralLoadGroup</I> which shall normally be of the type
		LOAD_COMBINATION_GROUP (see also <I>IfcLoadGroupTypeEnum</I>). If an
		enumeration item is missing for an appropriate definition of a load group, the
		item USERDEFINED shall be used instead. In this case, a meaning can be given by
		using the <I>IfcActionSourceTypeEnum</I>. </P>
