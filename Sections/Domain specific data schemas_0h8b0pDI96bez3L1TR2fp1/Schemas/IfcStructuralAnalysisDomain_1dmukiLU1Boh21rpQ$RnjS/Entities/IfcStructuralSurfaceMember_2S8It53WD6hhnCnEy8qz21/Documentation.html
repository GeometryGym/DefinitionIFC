	 <P>Instances of <I>IfcStructuralSurfaceMember</I> shall have a topology
		representation. It includes a placement and a product representation. The
		<I>IfcProductRepresentation</I> shall be given by an item of

	 <P><B>Placement</B></P> 
	 <P>The placement for <I>IfcStructuralSurfaceMember</I> is determined at its
		supertype <I>IfcProduct</I>. It is defined by the optional

		that is referenced by all topological representations of that product. </P>

		  which are given object coordinates.

				<I>IfcLocalPlacement</I> is given, it shall point to the local placement of the
