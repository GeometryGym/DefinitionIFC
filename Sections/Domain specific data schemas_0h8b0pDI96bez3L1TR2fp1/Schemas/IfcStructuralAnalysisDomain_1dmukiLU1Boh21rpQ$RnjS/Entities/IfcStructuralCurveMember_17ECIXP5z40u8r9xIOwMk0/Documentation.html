<p><u>Definition
from IAI:</u> Instances of the
entity <i>IfcStructuralCurveMember</i>
shall be used to describe linear structural elements. Profile and
material properties are defined by using objectified relationships:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The material properties are
defined by <i>IfcMechanicalMaterialProperties</i>
(and subtypes), they are connected through <i>IfcMaterial</i>
and <i>IfcRelAssociatesMaterial</i>
and are accessible via the inherited inverse relationship <i>HasAssociations</i>.</li>
  <li>The profile properties are
defined by <i>IfcMechanicalProfileProperties</i>
(and subtypes), they are connected through <i>IfcRelAssociatesProfileProperties</i>
and are accessible via the inherited inverse relationship <i>HasAssociations</i>.</li>
</ul>

sufficient, since a linear interpolation between the two vertices is

form, the <i>IfcEdgeCurve</i>
needs to be used instead, having the

<p><b><u>Topology
Use Definition</u></b></p>
<p>Instances of <i>IfcStructuralCurveMember</i>
shall have a topology
representation. It includes a placement and a product representation.
The <i>IfcProductRepresentation</i>
shall be given by an item of <i>Representations</i>
being of type "<i>IfcTopologyRepresentation</i>".
</p>
<p><b>Placement</b></p>
<p>The placement for <i>IfcStructuralCurveMember</i>
is determined at
its supertype <i>IfcProduct</i>.
It is defined by the optional <i>IfcObjectPlacement</i>,
referenced by <i>ObjectPlacement</i>
at <i>IfcProduct</i>,
which
establishes, if given, the object coordinate system that is referenced
by all topological representations of that product. </p>
<ul>
  <li>If the <i>ObjectPlacement</i>
attribute is omitted, then all
topological representations are given directly in world coordinates.
This is the preferred representation.</li>
  <li>If the <i>ObjectPlacement</i>
attribute is provided, then it
establishes an object coordinate system for all topological
representations which are given object coordinates.
    <ul>
      <li>If the <i>PlacementRelTo</i>
relationship of <i>IfcLocalPlacement</i>
is omitted, the object coordinate system is established within the
world coordinate system.</li>
      <li>If the <i>PlacementRelTo</i>
relationship of <i>IfcLocalPlacement</i>
is given, it shall point to the local placement of the same <i>IfcSpatialStructureElement</i>,
which is used in the <i>ContainedInStructure</i>
inverse attribute, or
to a spatial structure element at a higher level, referenced by that. </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
<p><b>Topology
Representation</b></p>
<p>Instances of <i>IfcStructuralCurveMember</i>
shall have a topology
representation given by an edge with an optional additional geometric
representation of the included curve. It can be provided by either</p>
<ul>
  <li><i>IfcEdge</i></li>
  <li><i>IfcOrientedEdge</i></li>
  <li><i>IfcEdgeCurve</i></li>
</ul>
<p>which should be the single item
of <i>IfcTopologyRepresentation.Items</i>.
The <i>IfcEdge</i>
might be referenced by two or many <i>IfcSubedge</i>,
representing sections of the <i>IfcStructuralCurveMember</i>
with
changing properties. See subtype <i>IfcStructuralCurveMemberVarying</i>
for the use definition.</p>
