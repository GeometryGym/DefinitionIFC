	 <P><U>Definition from IAI:</U> The abstract entity
		<I>IfcStructuralActivity</I> combines the definition of actions (such as
		forces, displacement, etc) and reactions (supports and deformations) which are
		specified by using the basic load definitions from
		the<I>IfcStructuralLoadResource</I>. It also uses the inherited capabilities
		for the definition of a location and a local coordinate system.</P> 
	 <P>The differentiation between actions and reactions is realized by
		instantiating objects either from subclasses of <I>IfcStructuralAction</I> or
		<I>IfcStructuralReaction</I> respectively. They inherit commonly needed
		attributes from the abstract superclass <I>IfcStructuralActivity</I>. Possible
		dependencies between actions and reactions must be explicitly captured.</P> 
	 <P>The use of the location and local coordinate system, given by
		<I>ObjectPlacement</I>, is optional as it is not always needed or useful.</P>

		<P><FONT SIZE="-1">NOTE: Not needed if the 'activity' acts on the whole
		  element to which it is "connected" through an instance of
		  <I>IfcRelConnectsStructuralActivity</I> and additionally, there is no
		  eccentricity. It is not useful if the 'activity' acts on a building element
		  because at this stage no geometrical abstraction is normally made.</FONT></P>

		<P><FONT SIZE="-1">NOTE: The definition of an 'activity' is normally used
		  for the structural engineering domain, where the activity typically defines no
		  own coordinate system but rather uses the coordinate system of the element on
		  which it acts. Therefore the definition of a location and local coordinate
		  system can be omitted by not assigning a value to <I>ObjectPlacement</I>, in
		  these cases the local coordinate system shall correspond to the local
		  coordinate system of the structural item or building element on which it acts.

	 <P>In addition the <I>IfcStructuralActivity</I> defines the relation needed
		to associate actions and/or reactions to the <I>IfcStructuralItem</I> to which
		it applies.</P>
