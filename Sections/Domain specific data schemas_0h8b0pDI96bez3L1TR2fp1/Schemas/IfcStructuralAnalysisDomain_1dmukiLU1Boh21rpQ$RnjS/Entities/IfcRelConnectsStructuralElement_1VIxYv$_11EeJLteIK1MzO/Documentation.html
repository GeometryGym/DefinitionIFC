<p><u>Definition from IAI:</u> The one-to-one
relationship assigns a structural member (as instance of <i>IfcStructuralMember</i>
or its subclasses) to a physical element&nbsp; (as instance of <i>IfcElement</i>
or its subclasses) to keep the association between the design or
detailing element and the structural analysis element.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Both, the <i>IfcElement</i> and the <i>IfcStructuralMember</i>,
may involve any number (zero, one, or many) associations between
physical and analytical element. Multiple instances of <i>IfcRelConnectsStructuralElement</i>
can therefore be used to reflect the many-to-many nature of the
association between physical and analytical elements.</p>
