<p><u>Definition
from IAI</u>: The <i>IfcRelAssociatesProfileProperties</i>
is an objectified relationship between non geometric profile properties
(subtypes of <i>IfcProfileProperties</i>)
and elements to which these properties apply, e.g. building elements
and building element types as used within the structural engineering
domain for steel, timber or concrete structures.</p>
<p>If the <i>ProfileSectionLocation</i>
attribute is given, it points to a shape aspect of the geometric or
topological representation of the structural member. This allows the
assignment of several profile properties (by many instances of <i>IfcRelAssociatesProfileProperties</i>)
to accommodate varying profiles and members with different profile
sections.</p>
<p>If the <i>ProfileOrientation</i>
attribute is given, it provides an orientation of the profile.</p>
<ul>
  <li>For <i>IfcStructuralCurveMember</i>
it is a rotation about the longitudinal axis of the underlying curve,
the x axis is determined by a line from the start vertex to the end
vertex.&nbsp;</li>
  <ul>
    <li>If the longitudinal axis
is not parallel to the structural z axis of the structural coordinate
system of the analysis model, i.e. the curve member is a beam (or
non-vertical member), the <i>ProfileOrientation</i>
defaults to [0.,0.,1.] (if the z axis is not orthogonal to the x axis,
an adjustment is made to maintain orthogonality, see function <i>IfcBuildAxes</i>
for an algorithm). The &beta; angle is then measured from the
structural z axis to determine the location of the structural z axis of
the profile.&nbsp;</li>
    <li>If the longitudinal axis
is&nbsp;parallel to the structural z axis of the structural
coordinate
system of the analysis model, i.e. the curve member is a column, the <i>ProfileOrientation</i>
defaults to [1.,0.,0.]. The &beta; angle is then measured from the
structural x
axis to determine the location of the structural z axis of the profile.</li>
  </ul>
  <li>If the <i>ProfileOrientation</i>
attribute is given as an <i>IfcDirection</i>,
it would default to:</li>
  <ul>
    <li>For 'beams' as [0.,
sin&beta;, cos&beta; ]</li>
    <li>For 'columns' as
[cos&beta;, -sin&beta;, 0.]</li>
  </ul>
</ul>
