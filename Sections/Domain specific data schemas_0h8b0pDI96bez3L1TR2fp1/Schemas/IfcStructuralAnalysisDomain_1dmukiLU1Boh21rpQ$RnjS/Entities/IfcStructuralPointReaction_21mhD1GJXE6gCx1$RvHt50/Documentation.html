	 <P><U>Definition from IAI:</U> Instances of the entity
		<I>IfcStructuralPointReaction</I> are used to define point reactions.
		<I>IfcStructuralPointReaction</I> inherits all needed attributes from its
		superclass <I>IfcStructuralReaction</I>.</P> 
	 <P>The structural load, defining the point reaction is given by the
		attribute <I>AppliedLoad</I> at the supertype <I>IfcStructuralActivity</I>.
		The coordinate system, in which the <I>AppliedLoad</I> is defined is given by
		the attribute <I>ObjectPlacement</I> at the supertype <I>IfcProduct</I>.</P>

	 <P>Instances of <I>IfcStructuralPointReaction</I> shall have a topology

	 <P>The placement for <I>IfcStructuralPointReaction</I> is determined at its
		supertype <I>IfcProduct</I>. It is defined by the optional
		<I>IfcObjectPlacement</I>, referenced by <I>ObjectPlacement</I> at
		<I>IfcProduct</I>, which establishes, if given, the object coordinate system
		that is referenced by the applied load. </P>

		<LI>Ifc the <I>ObjectPlacement</I> attribute is provided, then it

				<I>IfcLocalPlacement</I> is given, it shall point to the local placement of the
