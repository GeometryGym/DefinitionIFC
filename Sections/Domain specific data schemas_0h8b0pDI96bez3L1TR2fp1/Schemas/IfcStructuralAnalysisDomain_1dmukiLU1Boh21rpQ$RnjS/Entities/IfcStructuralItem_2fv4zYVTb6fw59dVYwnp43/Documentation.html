<p><u>Definition

from IAI:</u> The abstract entity<i>

IfcStructuralItem</i> covers

structural members and structural connections. It defines the relation

needed to associate structural actions to structural members and

connections.</p>

<p><u><b>Topology

Use Definition</b></u></p>

<p>Instances of <i>IfcStructuralItem</i>

shall have a topology

representation. It includes a placement and a product representation.

The <i>IfcProductRepresentation</i>

shall be given by an item of <i>Representations</i>

being of type "<i>IfcTopologyRepresentation</i>".</p>

<p><b>Local

Placement</b></p>

<p>All <i>IfcStructuralItem</i>s which are grouped within
a common <i>IfcStructuralAnalysisModel</i> should have equal object placements.
Placement within the world coordinate system of the project is the easiest way
to ensure this, especially if structural items belong to more than one analysis
model.</p>

<p>All geometric entities within the topological representation (such as
<i>IfcVertexPoint</i>, <i>IfcEdgeCurve</i>, or <i>IfcFaceSurface</i>) are
founded in the object coordinate system established by <i>ObjectPlacement</i>.
