<p><u>Definition from IAI: </u>An <i>IfcLampType</i>
is a type of device that is designed to emit light. </p>
<blockquote> <font color="#0000ff" size="-1">HISTORY:
New entity in IFC 2x2 Addendum 1.</font></blockquote>
<p><u><b>Use Definitions</b></u></p>
<p>An <i>IfcLampType</i> provides for all forms of
lamp and its usage defines the parameters for one or more occurrences
of <i>IfcFlowTerminal</i>.</p>
<p>Instances of <i>IfcFlowTerminal</i> that are
defined as types of <i>IfcLampType</i> are connected via
instances of <i>IfcDistributionPort</i> to an instance of <i>IfcFlowTerminal</i>
that is defined as a type of <i>IfcLightFixtureType</i>.</p>
<p>Rendering using lighting data is achieved using light source
entities within the presentation capabilities of IFC.</p>
<p><u><b>Property Set Use Definition</b></u>:</p>
<p>The property sets relating to the <i>IfcLampType</i>are
defined by the <i>IfcPropertySet</i> and attached by the <i>IfcRelDefinesByType</i>
relationship. It is accessible by the inverse <i>IsDefinedBy</i>
relationship. The following property set definitions specific to an <i>IfcLampType</i>
are part of this IFC release:</p>
<ul>
  <li><a
 href="../../psd/IfcElectricalDomain/Pset_LampTypeCommon.xml">Pset_LampTypeCommon</a>:
property set for properties that are common to all types of lamp
installed within a light fixture, if available</li>
</ul>
<p><u><b>Geometry Use Definitions</b></u></p>
<p>Representations of the type are defined as representation maps
(at the level of the supertype <i>IfcTypeProduct</i>).
These are assigned at the occurrence through the <i>IfcShapeRepresentation.Item</i>
being an <i>IfcMappedItem</i>.</p>
