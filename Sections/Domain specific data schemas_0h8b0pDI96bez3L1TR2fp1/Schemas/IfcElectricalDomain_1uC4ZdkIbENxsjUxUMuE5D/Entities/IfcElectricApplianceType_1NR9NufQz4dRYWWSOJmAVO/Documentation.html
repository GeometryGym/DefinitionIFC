	 <p><u>Definition from IAI</u>: An <i>IfcElectricApplianceType</i>
defines a
particular type of common electrical appliance found in a typical
AEC/FM
facility. Electrical Appliances generally consist of electrical devices
that are not a fixed part of the building but instead can be moved from
one
space to another and are powered with electricity.</p>

<p><u><strong>Use Definitions</strong></u></p>
<p>An <i>IfcElectricApplianceType</i> is a subtype
of IfcFlowTerminalType
that provides for various forms of electrical appliance.</p>
<p>Usage of <i>IfcElectricApplianceType</i> defines
the parameters for
one or more occurrences of <i>IfcFlowTerminal</i>.</p>
<p><u><b>Property Set Use Definition</b></u>:</p>
<p>The property sets relating to the <i>IfcElectricApplianceType
</i>are defined by the <i>IfcPropertySet</i> and
attached by the <i>IfcRelDefinesByType</i> relationship.
It is accessible by the inverse <i>IsDefinedBy</i>
relationship. The following property set definitions specific to an <i>IfcElectricApplianceType
</i> are part of this IFC release:</p>
<ul>
  <li><a
 href="../../psd/IfcElectricalDomain/Pset_ElectricalDeviceCommon.xml">Pset_ElectricalDeviceCommon</a>:
property set for properties that are common to all types of electrical
devices, if available </li>
</ul>
<p><u><b>Geometry Use Definitions</b></u></p>
<p>Representations of the type are defined as representation maps
(at the level of the supertype <i>IfcTypeProduct</i>).
These are assigned at the occurrence through the <i>IfcShapeRepresentation.Item</i>
being an <i>IfcMappedItem</i>.</p>
