<p><u><b>Property Set Use Definition</b></u>:</p>
<p>The property sets relating to the <i>IfcElectricDistributionPoint
</i>are
defined by the <i>IfcPropertySet</i> and attached by the <i>IfcRelDefinesByProperties</i>
relationship. It is accessible by the inverse <i>IsDefinedBy</i>
relationship. The following property set definitions specific to an <i>IfcElectricDistributionPoint
</i>are part of this IFC release:</p>
<ul>
  <li><a
 href="../../psd/IfcElectricalDomain/Pset_ElectricDistributionPointCommon.xml">Pset_ElectricDistributionPointCommon</a>:
common property set for all types of an electric distribution point
panel, distribution board etc.), if available </li>
</ul>
<p><b><u>Use Definitions</u></b></p>
<p>An <i>IfcElectricDistributionPoint</i> provides a
housing for an
aggregation of different types of instances of electrical distribution
elements so that they can be viewed, operated or acted upon from a
single place.
Each item in the aggregation may have its own geometric representation
and
location by virtue of being a subtype of <i>IfcProduct</i>.</p>
<p><i>IfcElectricDistributionPoint</i> acts as the
relating object in an
<i>IfcRelAggregates</i> relationship, the electrical
devices that are brought
together being the related objects.</p>
<p><u><b>Geometry Use Definitions</b></u></p>
<p>The geometric representation of an occurrence of an <em>IfcElectricDistributionPoint</em>
is given by the <i>IfcProductDefinitionShape</i>, allowing
multiple geometric representations. Included are:</p>
<p><b>Local Placement</b></p>
<p>The local placement is defined in the supertype <i>IfcProduct</i>.
It is defined by a subtype of <i>IfcObjectPlacement</i>
which can define an absolute placement, relative placement, or grid
reference, with each defining the local coordinate system referenced by
all geometric representations. The PlacementRelTo relationship of <i>IfcLocalPlacement</i>,
if given, shall point to the same <i>IfcSpatialStructureElement</i>
which is used in the ContainedInStructure inverse attribute, or to a
referenced spatial structure element at a higher level. If the relative
placement is not used, the absolute placement is defined within the
world coordinate system.</p>
<p><u>Informal propositions for local placement</u>: </p>
<ol>
  <li>If the LocalPlacement is specified, then all aggregated
components should use this placement as their relative placement. </li>
</ol>
<p><b>Standard Geometric Representation</b></p>
<p>Currently, the use of profiles to define the geometry for an
occurrence of this class is not supported. The standard geometric
representation is defined using explicit geometry.</p>
<p><b>B-Rep Representation </b></p>
<p>The faceted B-Rep capabilities (with or without voids) shall
be supported for B-Rep representation.</p>
