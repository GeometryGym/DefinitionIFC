<p><u><b>Use Definitions</b></u></p>
<p> A cable segment type is used to define the common properties
of a cable
segment that may be applied to many occurrences of that type. A cable
segment is used to typically join two sections of an electrical network
or a
network of components carrying the electrical service. Cable segment
types may be
exchanged without being already assigned to occurrences.</p>
<p>The occurrences of the <i>IfcCableSegmentType</i>
are represented by instances of <i>IfcFlowSegment</i>
or its subtypes.</p>
<p><u><b>Property Set Use Definition</b></u>:</p>
<p>The property sets relating to the <i>IfcCableSegmentType
</i>are defined by the <i>IfcPropertySet</i> and
attached by the <i>IfcRelDefinesByType</i> relationship.
It is accessible by the inverse <i>IsDefinedBy</i>
relationship. The following property set definitions specific to the <i>IfcCableSegmentType
</i>are part of this IFC release:</p>
<ul>
  <li><a
 href="../../psd/IfcElectricalDomain/Pset_CableSegmentTypeCableSegment.xml">Pset_CableSegmentTypeCableSegment</a>:
specific property set for the properties of a whole cable (including
the aggregation of conductors within the cable), if available </li>
  <li><a
 href="../../psd/IfcElectricalDomain/Pset_CableSegmentTypeConductorSegment.xml">Pset_CableSegmentTypeConductorSegment</a>:
specific property set for the properties of an individual conductor
within an electrical cable, if available.</li>
</ul>
<p><u><b>Geometry Use Definitions</b></u></p>
<p>Representations of the type are defined as representation maps
(at the level of the supertype <i>IfcTypeProduct</i>).
These are assigned at the occurrence through the <i>IfcShapeRepresentation.Item</i>
being an <i>IfcMappedItem</i>.</p>
