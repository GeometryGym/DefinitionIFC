<p><u>Definition from IAI: </u>An <i>IfcLightFixtureType</i>
is a container type that is designed for the purpose of housing one or
more lamps and the devices that control, restrict or vary their
emission. </p>
<blockquote> <font color="#0000ff" size="-1">HISTORY:
New class in IFC 2x2.</font></blockquote>
<p><u><b>Use Definitions</b></u></p>
<p>An <i>IfcLightFixtureType</i> provides for all
forms of light fixture and its usage defines the parameters for one or
more occurrences of <i>IfcFlowTerminal</i>.</p>
<p>Instances of <i>IfcFlowTerminal</i> that are
defined as types of <i>IfcLightFixtureType</i> have one or
more instances of <i>IfcFlowTerminal</i> that are defined
as types of <i>IfcLampType</i> connected using instances
of <i>IfcDistributionPort</i>.</p>
<p>Rendering using lighting data is achieved using light source
entities within the presentation capabilities of IFC.</p>
<p><u><b>Property Set Use Definition</b></u>:</p>
<p>The property sets relating to the <i>IfcLightFixtureType
</i>are defined by the <i>IfcPropertySet</i> and
attached by the <i>IfcRelDefinesByType</i> relationship.
It is accessible by the inverse <i>IsDefinedBy</i>
relationship. The following property set definitions specific to an <i>IfcLightFixtureType</i>
are part of this IFC release:</p>
<ul>
  <li><a
 href="../../psd/IfcElectricalDomain/Pset_ElectricalDeviceCommon.xml">Pset_ElectricalDeviceCommon</a>:
property set for properties that are common to all types of electrical
devices, if available </li>
  <li><a
 href="../../psd/IfcElectricalDomain/Pset_LightFixtureTypeCommon.xml">Pset_LightFixtureTypeCommon</a>:
property set for properties that are common to all types of light
fixture, if available </li>
  <li><a
 href="../../psd/IfcElectricalDomain/Pset_LightFixtureTypeThermal.xml">Pset_LightFixtureTypeThermal</a>:
specific property set for the thermal properties of a light fixture, if
available </li>
  <li><a
 href="../../psd/IfcElectricalDomain/Pset_LightFixtureTypeExitSign.xml">Pset_LightFixtureTypeExitSign</a>:
specific property set for the properties of an exit sign, if available</li>
</ul>
<p><u><b>Geometry Use Definitions</b></u></p>
<p>Representations of the type are defined as representation maps
(at the level of the supertype <i>IfcTypeProduct</i>).
These are assigned at the occurrence through the <i>IfcShapeRepresentation.Item</i>
being an <i>IfcMappedItem</i>.</p>
