		<TR> 
		  <TD>INDUCTION</TD> 
		  <TD>An alternating current motor in which the primary winding on one
			 member (usually the stator) is connected to the power source and a secondary
			 winding or a squirrel-cage secondary winding on the other member (usually the
			 rotor) carries the induced current. There is no physical electrical connection
			 to the secondary winding, its current is induced.</TD>

		  <TD>POLYPHASE</TD> 
		  <TD>A two or three-phase induction motor in which the windings, one for
			 each phase, are evenly divided by the same number of electrical degrees. </TD> 
		  <TD></TD> 
		</TR> 
		<TR> 
		  <TD>RELUCTANCESYNCHRONOUS</TD> 
		  <TD>A synchronous motor with a special rotor design which directly
			 lines the rotor up with the rotating magnetic field of the stator, allowing for
			 no slip under load. </TD> 
		  <TD></TD> 
		</TR> 
		<TR> 
		  <TD>SYNCHRONOUS</TD> 
		  <TD>A motor that operates at a constant speed up to full load. The
			 rotor speed is equal to the speed of the rotating magnetic field of the stator;
			 there is no slip.</TD>
