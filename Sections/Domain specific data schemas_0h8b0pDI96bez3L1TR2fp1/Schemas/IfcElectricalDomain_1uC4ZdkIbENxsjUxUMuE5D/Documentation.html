	 <P>The <I>IfcElectricalDomain</I> schema forms part of the Domain Layer of
		the IFC Model. It extends the ideas concerning building services outlined in
		the <I>IfcSharedBldgServicesElements</I> schema. It defines concepts of
		electrical supply and provision and concepts of light fixtures and illuminance
		within buildings. </P> 
	 <H3>Scope</H3> 
	 <P>The scope of the IfcElectrical domain is defined as:</P> 
	 <OL> 
		<LI>low voltage electrical installations from 12V (AC/DC) to 1000V (AC)
		  or 1500 volts (DC) in accordance with IEC definitions where installations in
		  scope are considered to commence at a meter where the public utility supply
		  terminates or at a transformer where voltage is stepped down to the low voltage
		  range in scope,</LI> 
		<LI>connection of equipment to circuits, distribution points etc,</LI> 
		<LI>steady state operation of electrical installations,</LI> 
		<LI>light fixtures (fittings), their types and the provision of such
		  information as is necessary to enable lighting calculations that provide
		  physically accurate illuminance.</LI> 
	 </OL> 
	 <P>The <I>IfcElectricalDomain</I> schema supports ideas including types of:
		</P> 
	 <UL> 
		<LI>cable carrier fittings (for conduit, cable tray, cable duct and
		  ladder),</LI> 
		<LI>electrical appliance,</LI> 
		<LI>electric heater,</LI> 
		<LI>electric motor,</LI> 
		<LI>distribution points including various types of control, mimic and
		  indicator panels,</LI> 
		<LI>generator,</LI> 
		<LI>junction box,</LI> 
		<LI>light fixture,</LI> 
		<LI>lamp,</LI> 
		<LI>outlet,</LI> 
		<LI>protective device,</LI> 
		<LI>switching device,</LI> 
		<LI>transformer,</LI>  
	 </UL> 
	 <H4>Out of Scope</H4> 
	 <P>The following are deemed to be out of scope of the <I>IfcElectricalDomain</I> schema
		at this time: </P> 
	 <UL> 
		<LI>medium and high voltage installations over 1000 volts AC and 1500
		  volts DC</LI> 
		<LI>systems with voltage of less than 12 volts (AC/DC)</LI> 
		<LI>public utility supply of electrical services</LI> 
		<LI>path of cables/conductors (other than as logical paths identifying
		  connection sequence)</LI> 
		<LI>cable routers (cable ladders)</LI> 
		<LI>electrical appliances like fax machines, phones, printers etc other
		  than as defined as electric appliances for the purposes of identification.</LI>
		
		<LI>non steady state/transient states of operation of electrical
		  installations</LI> 
		<LI>security arrangements associated with safety of electrical
		  installations</LI> 
		<LI>communication signals between automation devices or bus systems</LI> 
		<LI>sensors (which are dealt with in the IfcBuildingControl domain
		  schema)</LI> 
		<LI>computer network cabling and devices used on networks</LI> 
		<LI>spotlight mirror systems whereby a spotlight is directed towards a
		  distant mirror that the distributes the light energy (other than as a group of
		  separately defined objects)</LI> 
		<LI>lighting for specialist purposes (e.g. stage, painting, etc.) </LI> 
		<LI>properties and provisions that enable the visual display or rendering
		  of surfaces under illuminance (rendering, as in VRML, and photo accurate
		  simulation are within the scope of the <I>IfcPresentationResource</I>
		  schema.</LI> 
	 </UL> 
	 <H3>Occurrence</H3> 
	 <P>Many classes within this schema define types of elements that are used
		in electrical building services. They are defined either as subtypes of
		IfcTypeProduct or of other classes that are themselves subtypes of
		IfcTypeProduct. </P> 
	 <P>The objective is that a particular type of element is defined once in an
		IFC exchange. Occurrences of elements conforming to a particular
		type are defined by instances of related subtypes of IfcDistributionElement.
		Details of the relevant occurrence subtype are provided in the documentation
		for the type class. </P> 
	 <H3>Electrical Circuit</H3> 
	 <P>Electrical devices form part of an electrical circuit. An instance of an
		electrical circuit is defined as a named instance of IfcSystem.</P>
