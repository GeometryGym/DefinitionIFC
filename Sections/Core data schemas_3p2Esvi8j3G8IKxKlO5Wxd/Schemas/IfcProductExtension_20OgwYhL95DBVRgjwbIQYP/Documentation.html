      The <i>IfcProductExtension</i> further specializes the
      concepts of a (physical) product, i.e. a component likely
      to have a shape and a placement within the project context.
      The product information is provided for individual product
      occurrences as subtypes of <i>IfcProduct</i>, and for
      common specific product types as subtypes of
      IfcTypeProduct. Both definitions are rooted in
      supertypes provided within the <i>IfcKernel</i>. Basis
      concepts, introduced within the <i>IfcProductExtension</i>,
      are:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>the spatial project structure,
      </li>
      <li>the element,
      </li>
      <li>the grid,
      </li>
      <li>the port, and 
      </li>
      <li>the annotation.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      The spatial project structure defines
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>the site, 
      </li>
      <li>the building, 
      </li>
      <li>the building storey, and 
      </li>
      <li>the space 
      </li>
    </ul>and its decomposition structure. In addition the
    concepts of system and zone are introduced within the
    <i>IfcProductExtension</i>. Relationships between the spatial
    structure and the elements are defined, such as spatial
    containment and space boundaries.
    <p>
      An element is assigned to the spatial project structure and
      may refer by its placement to a grid. Basic types of
      elements, which are introduced are
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>building element
      </li>
      <li>opening element
      </li>
      <li>furnishing element
      </li>
      <li>distribution element (including heating, ventilation,
      air conditioning, electrical and equipment elements)
      </li>
      <li>transportation element
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      The other concepts introduced are 
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>a grid, providing a constraint placement for elements, 
      </li>
      <li>an annotation to capture any additional annotations to
      a building model or plan (such as explanatory text,
      dimensioning, etc.), and
      </li>
      <li>a port, providing connectivity between elements.
      </li>
    </ul>
