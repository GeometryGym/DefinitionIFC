      <u>Definition from IAI</u>: The space boundary
      (<i>IfcRelSpaceBoundary</i>) defines the physical or
      virtual delimiter of a space as its relationship to the
      surrounding elements.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>In the case of physical space boundary, the placement
      and shape of the boundary may be given, and the building
      element, providing the boundary, is referenced,
      </li>
      <li>In the case of virtual space boundary, the placement
      and shape of the boundary may be given, but no building
      element is referenced.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      The exact definition of how space boundaries are broken
      down depends on the view, more detailed conventions on how
      space boundaries are decomposed can only be given at the
      domain or application type level.

        <font size="-1">EXAMPLE: In an architectural or FM
        related view, a space boundary is defined from the inside
        of the space and does not take the providing building
        element into account. A plane area (even if the building
        element changes) is still seen as a single space
        boundary. In an HVAC related view, the decomposition of
        the space boundary depends on the material of the
        providing building element and the adjacent spaces
        behind.</font>
