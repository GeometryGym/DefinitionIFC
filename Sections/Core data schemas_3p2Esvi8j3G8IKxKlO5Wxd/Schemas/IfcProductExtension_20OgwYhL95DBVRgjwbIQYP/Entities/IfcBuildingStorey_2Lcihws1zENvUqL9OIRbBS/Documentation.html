      <u>Definition from IAI</u>: The building storey has an
      elevation and typically represents a (nearly) horizontal
      aggregation of spaces that are vertically bound.
    </p>
    <p>
      A storey is (if specified) associated to a building. A
      storey may span over several connected storeys. Therefore
      storey complex provides for a collection of storeys
      included in a building. A storey can also be decomposed in
      (horizontal) parts, where each part defines a partial
      storey. This is defined by the composition type attribute
      of the supertype <i>IfcSpatialStructureElements</i> which
      is interpreted as follow:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>COMPLEX = building storey complex
      </li>
      <li>ELEMENT = building storey
      </li>
      <li>PARTIAL = partial building storey
      </li>
    </ul>
    <blockquote>
      <font size="-1">EXAMPLE: In split level houses, a storey is
      split into two or more partial storeys, each with a
      different elevation. It can be handled by defining a
      storey, which includes two or more partial storeys with the
      individual elevations.</font>

      <u><b>Spatial Structure Use Definition</b></u>
    </p>
    <p>
      The <i>IfcBuildingStorey</i> is used to build the spatial
      structure of a building (that serves as the primary project
      breakdown and is required to be hierarchical). The spatial
      structure elements are linked together by using the
      objectified relationship <i>IfcRelAggregates</i>. The
      <i>IfcBuildingStorey</i>references them by its inverse
      relationships:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <i>IfcBuildingStorey.Decomposes</i> -- referencing
        (<i>IfcBuilding</i> || <i>IfcBuildingStorey</i>) by
        <i>IfcRelAggregates.RelatingObject</i>, If it refers to
        another instance of <i>IfcBuildingStorey</i>, the
        referenced <i>IfcBuildingStorey</i> needs to have a
        different and higher <i>CompositionType</i>, i.e. COMPLEX
        (if the other <i>IfcBuildingStorey</i> has ELEMENT), or
        ELEMENT (if the other <i>IfcBuildingStorey</i> has
        PARTIAL).
      </li>
      <li>
        <i>IfcBuildingStorey.IsDecomposedBy</i> -- referencing
        (<i>IfcBuildingStorey</i> || <i>IfcSpace</i>) by
        <i>IfcRelAggregates.RelatedObjects</i>. If it refers to
        another instance of <i>IfcBuildingStorey</i>, the
        referenced <i>IfcBuildingStorey</i> needs to have a
        different and lower CompositionType, i.e. ELEMENT (if the
        other <i>IfcBuildingStorey</i> has COMPLEX), or PARTIAL
        (if the other <i>IfcBuildingStorey</i> has ELEMENT).
      </li>
    </ul>If there are building elements and/or other elements
    directly related to the <i>IfcBuildingStorey</i> (like most
    building elements, such as walls, columns, etc.), they are
    associated with the <i>IfcBuildingStorey</i> by using the
    objectified relationship
    <i>IfcRelContainedInSpatialStructure</i>. The
    <i>IfcBuildingStorey</i> references them by its inverse
    relationship:<br>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <i>IfcBuildingStorey.ContainsElements</i> -- referencing
        any subtype of <i>IfcProduct</i> (with the exception of

      <b><u>Geometry Use Definitions</u></b>
    </p>
    <p>
      The geometric representation of <i>IfcBuildingStorey</i> is
      given by the <i>IfcProductDefinitionShape</i> and
      <i>IfcLocalPlacement</i>, allowing multiple geometric
      representation.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Local Placement</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      The local placement for <i>IfcBuildingStorey</i> is defined
      in its supertype <i>IfcProduct</i>. It is defined by the
      <i>IfcLocalPlacement</i>, which defines the local
      coordinate system that is referenced by all geometric
      representations.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>The <i>PlacementRelTo</i> relationship of
      <i>IfcLocalPlacement</i> shall point (if relative placement
      is used) to the <i>IfcSpatialStructureElement</i> of type
      <i>IfcBuilding</i>, or of type <i>IfcBuildingStorey</i>
      (e.g. to position a building storey relative to a building
      storey complex, or a partial building storey to a building
      storey).
      </li>
      <li>If the relative placement is not used, the absolute
      placement is defined within the world coordinate system.

    </ul>
    <p>
      <b><u>Geometric Representations</u></b>
    </p>
    <p>
      Currently, the use of a 2D 'FootPrint' representation of
      type 'GeometricCurveSet' and a 3D 'Body' representation of
      type 'Brep' is supported.
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        <small>NOTE The independent geometric representation of
        <i>IfcBuildingStorey</i> may not be required or allowed
        in certain view definitions. In those cases only the
        contained elements and spaces have an independent
        geometric representation.</small>
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>Foot Print Representation</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      The foot print representation of <i>IfcBuildingStorey</i>
      is given by either a single 2D curve (such as
      <i>IfcPolyline</i> or <i>IfcCompositeCurve</i>), or by a
      list of 2D curves (in case of inner boundaries), if the
      building storey has an independent geometric
      representation.
    </p>
    <p>
      The representation identifier and type of this geometric
      representation of <i>IfcBuildingStorey</i> is:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <i>IfcShapeRepresentation.RepresentationIdentifier</i> =
        'FootPrint'
      </li>
      <li>
        <i>IfcShapeRepresentation.RepresentationType</i> =
        'GeometricCurveSet'
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      <b>Body Representation</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      The body (or solid model) geometric representation (if the
      building storey has an independent geometric
      representation) of <i>IfcBuildingStorey</i> is defined
      using faceted B-Rep capabilities (with or without voids),
      based on the <i>IfcFacetedBrep</i> or on the
      <i>IfcFacetedBrepWithVoids</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      The representation identifier and type of this
      representation of <i>IfcBuildingStorey</i> is:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <i>IfcShapeRepresentation.RepresentationIdentifier</i> =
        'Body'
      </li>
      <li>
        <i>IfcShapeRepresentation.RepresentationType</i> = 'Brep'
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Since the building storey shape is usually described by the
      exterior building elements, an independent shape
      representation shall only be given, if the building storey
      is exposed independently from its constituting elements.
