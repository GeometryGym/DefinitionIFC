      <u>Definition from IAI</u>: A container class that
      represents complex element assemblies aggregated from
      several elements, such as discrete elements, building
      elements, or other elements.

        <small>EXAMPLE Steel construction assemblies, such as
        trusses and different kinds of frames, can be represented
        by the <i>IfcElementAssembly</i> entity. Other examples
        include slab fields aggregated from a number of precast
        concrete slabs or reinforcement units made from several
        reinforcement bars.</small>

      <u><b>Containment Use Definition</b></u>
    </p>
    <p>
      The <i>IfcElementAssembly</i> should have (and in most
      implementation scenarios it is mandatory) a relationship
      for its hierarchical containment in the spatial structure of
      the project.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>The <i>IfcElementAssembly</i> is placed within the
      project spatial hierarchy using the objectified
      relationship <i>IfcRelContainedInSpatialStructure</i>,
      referring to it by its inverse attribute
      <i>SELF\IfcElement.ContainedInStructure</i>. Subtypes
      of <i>IfcSpatialStructureElement</i> are valid spatial
      containers, with <i>IfcBuildingStorey</i> being the default
      container.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      The <i>IfcElementAssembly</i> shall represent an aggregate,
      i.e. it should have other elements, being subtypes of
      <i>IfcElement</i>, as contained (sub)parts.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>The <i>IfcElementAssembly</i> is an aggregate i.e.
      being composed by other elements and acting as an assembly
      using the objectified relationship <i>IfcRelAggregates</i>,
      referring to it by its inverse attribute
      <i>SELF\IfcObjectDefinition.IsDecomposedBy</i>. Components
      of an assembly are described by instances of subtypes of
      <i>IfcElement</i>.
      </li>
      <li>In this case, the contained subtypes of
      <i>IfcElement</i> shall not be additionally contained in
      the project spatial hierarchy, i.e. the inverse attribute
      <i>SELF\IfcElement.ContainedInStructure</i> of those
      <i>IfcElement</i>'s shall be <i>NIL.</i>
      </li>
    </ul>

      <u><b>Geometry Use Definitions</b></u>
    </p>
    <p>
      The geometric representation of <i>IfcElementAssembly</i>
      is given by the <i>IfcProductDefinitionShape</i>, allowing
      multiple geometric representations.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Local Placement</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      The local placement for <i>IfcElementAssembly</i> is
      defined in its supertype <i>IfcProduct</i>. It is defined
      by the <i>IfcLocalPlacement</i>, which defines the local
      coordinate system that is referenced by all geometric
      representations.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>The <i>PlacementRelTo</i> relationship of
      <i>IfcLocalPlacement</i> shall point (if given) to the
      local placement of the same
      <i>IfcSpatialStructureElement</i> that is used in the
      <i>ContainedInStructure</i> inverse attribute or to a
      referenced spatial structure element at a higher level.
      </li>
      <li>If the relative placement is not used, the absolute
      placement is defined within the world coordinate system.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      <u><b>Geometric Representations</b></u>
    </p>
    <p>
      The geometry of an <i>IfcElementAssembly</i> is generally
      formed from its components, in which case it does not need
      to have an explicit geometric representation. In some cases
      it may be useful to also expose a simple explicit
      representation as a bounding box representation of the
      complex composed shape independently.
    </p>
    <p>
      <u>Informal proposition</u>
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>The <i>IfcElementAssembly</i> shall have an aggregation
      relationship to the contained parts, i.e. the
      (INV) <i>IsDecomposedBy</i> relationship shall be utilized.
      </li>
    </ol>
