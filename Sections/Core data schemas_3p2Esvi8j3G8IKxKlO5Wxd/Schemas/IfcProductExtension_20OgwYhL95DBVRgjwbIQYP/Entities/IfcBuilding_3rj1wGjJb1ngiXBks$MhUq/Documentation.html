      <u>Definition from ISO 6707-1:1989</u>: Construction work
      that has the provision of shelter for its occupants or
      contents as one of its main purpose and is normally
      designed to stand permanently in one place.
    </p>
    <p>
      <u>Definition from IAI</u>: A building represents a
      structure that provides shelter for its occupants or
      contents and stands in one place. The building is also used
      to provide a basic element within the spatial structure
      hierarchy for the components of a building project
      (together with site, storey, and space).
    </p>
    <p>
      A building is (if specified) associated to a site. A
      building may span over several connected or disconnected
      buildings. Therefore building complex provides for a
      collection of buildings included in a site. A building can
      also be decomposed in (vertical) parts, where each part
      defines a building section. This is defined by the
      composition type attribute of the supertype
      <i>IfcSpatialStructureElements</i> which is interpreted as
      follow:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>COMPLEX = building complex
      </li>
      <li>ELEMENT = building
      </li>
      <li>PARTIAL = building section
      </li>
    </ul>

      The <i>IfcBuilding</i> is used to build the spatial

      structure elements are linked together by using the
      objectified relationship <i>IfcRelAggregates</i>. The
      <i>IfcBuilding</i> references them by its inverse
      relationships:

        <i>IfcBuilding</i> needs to have a different and higher

      <u><b>Geometry Use Definitions</b></u>:

      The geometric representation of <i>IfcBuilding</i> is given by the

      <i>IfcLocalPlacement</i>, allowing multiple geometric
      representation.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Local Placement</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      The local placement for <i>IfcBuilding</i> is defined in
      its supertype <i>IfcProduct</i>. It is defined by the
      <i>IfcLocalPlacement</i>, which defines the local
      coordinate system that is referenced by all geometric
      representations.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>The <i>PlacementRelTo</i> relationship of
      <i>IfcLocalPlacement</i> shall point (if relative placement
      is used) to the <i>IfcSpatialStructureElement</i> of type
      <i>IfcSite</i>, or of type <i>IfcBuilding</i> (e.g. to position a
      building relative to a building complex, or a building
      section to a building).

      Currently, the use of a 2D 'FootPrint' representation of

      type 'Brep' is supported.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Foot Print Representation</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      The foot print representation of <i>IfcBuilding</i> is
      given by either a single 2D curve (such as
      <i>IfcPolyline</i> or <i>IfcCompositeCurve</i>), or by a
      list of 2D curves (in case of inner boundaries), if the
      building has an independent geometric representation.
    </p>
    <p>
      The representation identifier and type of this geometric
      representation of <i>IfcBuilding</i> is:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <i>IfcShapeRepresentation.RepresentationIdentifier</i> =
        'FootPrint'
      </li>
      <li>
        <i>IfcShapeRepresentation.RepresentationType</i> =
        'GeometricCurveSet'
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      <b>Body Representation</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      The body (or solid model) geometric representation (if the
      building has an independent geometric representation) of
      <i>IfcBuilding</i> is defined using faceted B-Rep
      capabilities (with or without voids), based on the
      <i>IfcFacetedBrep</i> or on the
      <i>IfcFacetedBrepWithVoids</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      The representation identifier and type of this
      representation of <i>IfcBuilding</i> is:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <i>IfcShapeRepresentation.RepresentationIdentifier</i> =
        'Body'
      </li>
      <li>
        <i>IfcShapeRepresentation.RepresentationType</i> = 'Brep'
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Since the building shape is usually described by the
      exterior building elements, an independent shape
      representation shall only be given, if the building is
      exposed independently from its constituting elements.
