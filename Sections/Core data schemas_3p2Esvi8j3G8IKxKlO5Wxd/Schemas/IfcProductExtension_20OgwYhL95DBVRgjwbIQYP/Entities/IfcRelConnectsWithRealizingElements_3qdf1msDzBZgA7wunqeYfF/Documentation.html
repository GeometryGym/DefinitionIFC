      <u>Definition from IAI</u>:
      <i>IfcRelConnectsWithRealizingElements</i> defines a
      generic relationship that is made between two elements that
      require the realization of that relationship by means of
      further realizing elements.
    </p>
    <p>
      An <i>IfcRelConnectsWithRealizingElements</i> is a
      specialization of <i>IfcRelConnectsElement</i> where the
      connecting operation has the additional attribute of (one
      or many) realizing elements that may be used to realize or
      further qualify the relationship. It is defined as a
      ternary relationship.

        <font size="-1">EXAMPLE: It may be used to describe the
        attachment of one element to another where the attachment
        is realized by a 'fixing' element such as a bracket. It
        may also be used to describe the mounting of one element
        onto another such as the requirement for the mounting
        major plant items onto builders work bases and/or
        anti-vibration isolators.</font>
