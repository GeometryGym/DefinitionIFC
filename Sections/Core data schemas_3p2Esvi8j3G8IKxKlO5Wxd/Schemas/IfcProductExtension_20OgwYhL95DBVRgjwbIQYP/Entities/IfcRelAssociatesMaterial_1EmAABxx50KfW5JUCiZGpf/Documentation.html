      <u>Definition from IAI</u>: Objectified relationship
      between a material definition and elements or element types
      to which this material definition applies. The material
      definition can be:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>A single material
      </li>
      <li>A material list, e.g. for composite elements
      </li>
      <li>A material layer set, for layered elements with an
      indication of the layering direction and individual layer
      thicknesses
      </li>
			<li>A material layer set usage, i.e. a material layer set
			with positioning information along the reference axis or
			surface of the element.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      The <i>IfcRelAssociatesMaterial</i> relationship is a
      special type of the <i>IfcRelAssociates</i> relationship.
      It can be applied to subtypes of <i>IfcElement</i> and
      subtypes of <i>IfcElementType</i>.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>The <i>IfcElement</i> has an inverse relation to its
      material definition by the <i>HasAssociations</i>
      attribute, inherited from <i>IfcObject</i>.
      </li>
      <li>The <i>IfcElementType</i> has an inverse relation to
      its material definition by the <i>HasAssociations</i>
      attribute, inherited from <i>IfcPropertyDefinition</i>.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      If both, the element occurrence
      (by an instance of <i>IfcElement</i>) and the element type
      (by an instance of <i>IfcElementType</i>, connected through
      <i>IfcRelDefinesByType</i>) have an associated material,
      then the material associated to the element occurrence
      overrides the material associated to the element type.

		<p><u>Informal proposition</u></p>
		<ol>
				<li>An <i>IfcMaterialLayerSetUsage</i> shall not be associated
				with a subtype of <i>IfcElementType</i>, it should only be
				associated with individual occurrences</li>
