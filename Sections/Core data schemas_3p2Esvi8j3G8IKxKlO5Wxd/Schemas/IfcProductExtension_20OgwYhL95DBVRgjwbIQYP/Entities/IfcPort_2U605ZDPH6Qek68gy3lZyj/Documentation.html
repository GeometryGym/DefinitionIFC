      <u>Definition from IAI</u>: An <i>IfcPort</i> provides the
      means for an element to connect to other elements.
    </p>
    <p>
      An <i>IfcPort</i> is associated with an <i>IfcElement</i>,
      it belongs to, through the objectified relationship
      <i>IfcRelConnectsPortToElement</i>. Exactly two ports,
      belonging to two different elements, are connected with
      each other through the objectified relationship
      <i>IfcRelConnectsPorts</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      An instance of <i>IfcElement</i> may have one or more
      points at which it connects to other instances of
      <i>IfcElement</i>. An instance of <i>IfcPort</i> is located
      at a point where a connection can occur. The location of
      the port is determined in the context of the local
      coordinate system of the element to which it belongs.

      <b><u>Containment Use Definitions</u></b>
    </p>
    <p>
      As a subordinate part being fully dependent on the master
      element the <i>IfcPort</i> shall have no
      independent containment relationship to the spatial
      structure.
    </p>
		    <p>
      <b><u>Geometry Use Definition</u></b>
    </p>
    <p>
      The geometric representation of <i>IfcPort</i> is
      given by the <i>IfcProductDefinitionShape</i>, allowing
      multiple geometric representation.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Local Placement</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      The local placement for <i>IfcPort</i> is defined
      in its supertype <i>IfcProduct</i>. It is defined by the
      <i>IfcLocalPlacement</i>, which defines the local
      coordinate system that is referenced by all geometric
      representations.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>The <i>PlacementRelTo</i> relationship of
      <i>IfcLocalPlacement</i> shall point to the
      local placement of the master <i>IfcElement</i> (its
      relevant subtypes), which is associated to the
      <i>IfcPort</i> by the relationship object
			<i>IfcRelConnectsPortToElement</i>.
      </li>
    </ul>
		    <p>
      <b>Shape Representation</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      The geometry use definitions for the shape representation
      of the <i>IfcPort</i> is given at the level of
      its subtypes.
