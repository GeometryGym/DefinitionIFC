      <u><b>Geometry Use Definitions</b></u>:
    </p>
    <p>
      The geometric representation of <i>IfcFurnishingElement</i>
      is given by the <i>IfcProductDefinitionShape</i> and
      <i>IfcLocalPlacement</i> allowing multiple geometric
      representation.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Local Placement</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      The local placement for <i>IfcFurnishingElement</i> is
      defined in its supertype <i>IfcProduct</i>. It is defined
      by the <i>IfcLocalPlacement</i>, which defines the local
      coordinate system that is referenced by all geometric
      representations.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>The <i>PlacementRelTo</i> relationship of
      <i>IfcLocalPlacement</i> shall point (if given) to the
      local placement of the same
      <i>IfcSpatialStructureElement</i> , which is used in the
      <i>ContainedInStructure</i> inverse attribute, or to a
      spatial structure element at a higher level, referenced by
      that.
      </li>
      <li>If the relative placement is not used, the absolute
      placement is defined within the world coordinate system.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      <b><i>Geometric Representations</i></b>
    </p>
    <p>
      Any <i>IfcFurnishingElement</i> can be represented by one
      or several geometric representations. This includes the
      general representation types 'BoundingBox',
      'GeometricCurveSet', 'SurfaceModel', 'Brep', and
      'MappedRepresentation' being defined here.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Bounding Box Representation</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      Any <i>IfcFurnishingElement</i> may be represented as a
      bounding box, which shows the maximum extend of the body
      within the coordinated system established by the
      <i>IfcLocalPlacement</i>. The bounding box representation
      is the simplest geometric representation available. The
      following attribute values for the
      <i>IfcShapeRepresentation</i> holding this geometric
      representation shall be used:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <i>RepresentationIdentifier</i> : 'Box'
      </li>
      <li>
        <i>RepresentationType</i> : 'BoundingBox'
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      <b>Foot Print Representation</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      The foot print representation of
      <i>IfcFurnishingElement</i> is given by either a single or
      multiple 2D points and curves. The representation
      identifier and type of this geometric representation are:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <i>IfcShapeRepresentation.RepresentationIdentifier</i> =
        'FootPrint'
      </li>
      <li>
        <i>IfcShapeRepresentation.RepresentationType</i> =
        'GeometricCurveSet'
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      <b>SurfaceModel Representation</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      Any <i>IfcFurnishingElement</i> (so far no further
      constraints are defined at the level of its subtypes) may
      be represented as a single or multiple surface models,
      based on either shell or face based models. In some cases
      it may be useful to also expose a simple representation as
      a bounding box representation of the same complex shape.
      The representation identifier and type of this geometric
      representation are:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <i>IfcShapeRepresentation.RepresentationIdentifier</i> =
        'Body'
      </li>
      <li>
        <i>IfcShapeRepresentation.RepresentationType</i> =
        'SurfaceModel'
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      <b>Brep Representation</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      Any <i>IfcFurnishingElement</i> (so far no further
      constraints are defined at the level of its subtypes) may
      be represented as a single or multiple Boundary
      Representation elements (which are restricted to faceted
      Brep with or without voids). The Brep representation allows
      for the representation of complex element shape. In some
      cases it may be useful to also expose a simple
      representation as a bounding box representation of the same
      complex shape. The representation identifier and type of
      this geometric representation are:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <i>IfcShapeRepresentation.RepresentationIdentifier</i> =
        'Body'
      </li>
      <li>
        <i>IfcShapeRepresentation.RepresentationType</i> = 'Brep'
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      <b>MappedRepresentation</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      The <i>IfcMappedItem</i> should always be used in
      appropriate cases as it allows for reusing the geometry
      definition of the furnishing type for all occurrences of
      the same type. The representation identifier and type of
      this geometric representation are:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <i>IfcShapeRepresentation.RepresentationIdentifier</i> =
        'FootPrint', or 'Body' (depending of the representation
        map)
      </li>
      <li>
        <i>IfcShapeRepresentation.RepresentationType</i> =
        'MappedRepresentation'
      </li>
    </ul>
