      <u>Definition from IAI</u>: Generalization of all equipment
      related objects, those objects are characterized as being
      pre-manufactured and being movable, and which provide some
      building service related or other servicing function. The
      term fixture is often used as a synonym or similar concept.
      The <i>IfcEquipmentElement</i> covers the fixture aspect as
      well.

      handled as distribution elements and class definitions are
      provided by subtypes of <i>IfcDistributionElement</i> for
      occurrences and <i>IfcDistributionElementType</i> for
      types. Equipment, that has no distribution function, is now

      <u>Geometry Use Definitions</u>:
    </p>
    <p>
      The geometric representation of <i>IfcEquipmentElement</i>
      is given by the <i>IfcProductDefinitionShape</i>, allowing
      multiple geometric representation.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Local Placement</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      The local placement for <i>IfcEquipmentElement</i> is
      defined in its supertype <i>IfcProduct</i>. It is defined
      by the <i>IfcLocalPlacement</i>, which defines the local
      coordinate system that is referenced by all geometric
      representations.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>The <i>PlacementRelTo</i> relationship of
      <i>IfcLocalPlacement</i> shall point (if given) to the
      local placement of the same
      <i>IfcSpatialStructureElement</i> , which is used in the
      <i>ContainedInStructure</i> inverse attribute, or to a
      spatial structure element at a higher level, referenced by
      that.
      </li>
      <li>If the relative placement is not used, the absolute
      placement is defined within the world coordinate system.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      <b>SurfaceModel Representation</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      Any <i>IfcEquipmentElement</i> (so far no further
      constraints are defined at the level of its subtypes) may
      be represented as a single or multiple surface models,
      based on either shell or face based models. It is ensured
      by assigning the value 'SurfaceModel' to the
      RepresentationType attribute of
      <i>IfcShapeRepresentation</i>. In some cases it may be
      useful to also expose a simple representation as a bounding
      box representation of the same complex shape.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Brep Representation</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      Any <i>IfcEquipmentElement</i> (so far no further
      constraints are defined at the level of its subtypes) may
      be represented as a single or multiple Boundary
      Representation elements (which are restricted to faceted
      Brep with or without voids). The Brep representation allows
      for the representation of complex element shape. It is
      ensured by assigning the value 'Brep' to the
      RepresentationType attribute of
      <i>IfcShapeRepresentation</i>. In some cases it may be
      useful to also expose a simple representation as a bounding
      box representation of the same complex shape.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>MappedRepresentation</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      The new mapped item, <i>IfcMappedItem</i>, should be used
      if appropriate as it allows for reusing the geometry
      definition of the equipment type at occurrences of the same
      equipment type. In this case the
      <i>IfcShapeRepresentation.RepresentationType</i> =
      MappedRepresentation is used.
