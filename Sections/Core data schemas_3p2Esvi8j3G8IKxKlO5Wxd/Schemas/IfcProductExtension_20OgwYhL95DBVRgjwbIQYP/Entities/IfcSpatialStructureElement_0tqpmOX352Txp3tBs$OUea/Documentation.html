      <u>Definition from IAI</u>: A spatial structure element
      (<i>IfcSpatialStructureElement</i>) is the generalization
      of all spatial elements that might be used to define a
      spatial structure. That spatial structure is often used to
      provide a project structure to organize a building project.
    </p>
    <p>
      A spatial project structure might define as many levels of
      decomposition as necessary for the building project.
      Elements within the spatial project structure are:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>site as <i>IfcSite</i>
      </li>
      <li>building as <i>IfcBuilding</i>
      </li>
      <li>storey as <i>IfcBuildingStorey</i>
      </li>
      <li>space as <i>IfcSpace</i>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      or aggregations or parts thereof. The composition type
      declares an element to be either an element itself, or an
      aggregation (complex) or a decomposition (part). The
      interpretation of these types is given at each subtype of
      <i>IfcSpatialStructureElement</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      The <i>IfcRelAggregates</i> is defined as an 1-to-many
      relationship and used to establish the relationship between
      exactly two levels within the spatial project structure.
      Finally the highest level of the spatial structure is
      assigned to <i>IfcProject</i> using the
      <i>IfcRelAggregates</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      <u>Informal proposition</u>:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>The spatial project structure, established by the
      <i>IfcRelAggregates</i>, shall be acyclic.
      </li>
      <li>A site should not be (directly or indirectly)
      associated to a building, storey or space.
      </li>
      <li>A building should not be (directly or indirectly)
      associated to a storey or space.
      </li>
      <li>A storey should not be (directly or indirectly)
      associated to a space.
      </li>
    </ol>
