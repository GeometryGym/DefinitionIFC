      <u>Definition from IAI</u>: The element type
      (<i>IfcTransportElementType</i>) defines a list of commonly
      shared property set definitions of an element and an
      optional set of product representations. It is used to
      define an element specification (i.e. the specific product
      information, that is common to all occurrences of that
      product type).
    </p>

        <font size="-1">NOTE: The product representations are
        defined as representation maps (at the level of the
        supertype <i>IfcTypeProduct</i>, which gets assigned by
        an element occurrence instance through the
        <i>IfcShapeRepresentation.Item[1]</i> being an
        <i>IfcMappedItem</i>.</font>

      A transport element type is used to define the common
      properties of a certain type of a transport element that
      may be applied to many instances of that type to assign a
      specific style. Transport element types (or the
      instantiable subtypes) may be exchanged without being
      already assigned to occurrences.
    </p>
    <p>
      The occurrences of the <i>IfcTransportElementType</i> are
      represented by instances of <i>IfcTransportElement</i> (or
      its subtypes).
