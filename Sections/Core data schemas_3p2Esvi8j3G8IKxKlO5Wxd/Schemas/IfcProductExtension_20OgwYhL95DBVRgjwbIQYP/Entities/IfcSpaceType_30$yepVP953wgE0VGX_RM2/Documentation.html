      <u>Definition from IAI</u>: The <i>IfcSpaceType</i>
      defines a list of commonly shared
      property set definitions of a space and an optional set of
      product representations. It is used to define an space
      specification (i.e. the specific space information, that is
      common to all occurrences of that space type).
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        <small>NOTE  The product representations are defined as
        representation maps (at the level of the supertype
        <i>IfcTypeProduct</i>, which gets assigned by an element
        occurrence instance through the
        <i>IfcShapeRepresentation.Item[1]</i> being an
        <i>IfcMappedItem</i>.</small>
      </p>

    <p>
      A space type is used to define the common properties of a
      certain type of space that may be applied to many instances
      of that type to assign a specific style. Space types may be
      exchanged without being already assigned to occurrences.
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        <small>NOTE  The space types are often used to represent
        space catalogues, less so for sharing a common
        representation map. Space types in a space catalogue
        share same space classification and a common set of space
        requirement properties.</small>

    <p>
      The occurrences of <i>IfcSpaceType</i> are represented by
      instances of <i>IfcSpace</i>.
