      <u>Definition from IAI</u>: An objectified relationship
      that defines the relationship between a system and the
      sites, buildings, storeys or spaces, it serves. Examples of
      systems are:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>building service systems (heating, cooling, waste water
      system) represented by instances of <i>IfcSystem</i>
      </li>
      <li>idealized structural analysis systems represented by
      instances of <i>IfcStructuralAnalysisSystem</i>
      </li>
    </ul>
