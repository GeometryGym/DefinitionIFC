      <u>Definition from IAI</u>: An
      <i>IfcRelConnectsPortToElement</i> defines the relationship
      that is made between a port and the <i>IfcElement</i> in
      which it is contained. It is a 1 to 1 relationship.
    </p>
		<p>Ports contained in different elements are connected to each
		other using the <i>IfcRelConnectsPorts</i> relationship. Using
		both relationships, a topological system can be defined.</p>
