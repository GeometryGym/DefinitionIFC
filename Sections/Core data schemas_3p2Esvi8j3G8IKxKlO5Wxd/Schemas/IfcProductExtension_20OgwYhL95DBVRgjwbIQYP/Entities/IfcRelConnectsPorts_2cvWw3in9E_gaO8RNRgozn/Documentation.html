      <u>Definition from IAI</u>: An <i>IfcRelConnectsPorts</i>
      defines the relationship that is made between two ports at
      their point of connection. It may include the connection
      geometry between two ports.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>IfcRelConnectsPorts</i> is required for defining how
      instances of <i>IfcPort</i> connect together. Each of the
      port is being logically attached to the <i>IfcElement</i>
      by using the <i>IfcRelConnectsPortToElement</i>
      relationship.
