      <u>Definition from IAI</u>: A specialization of the general
      feature element, that represents an existence dependent
      elements which modifies the shape and appearance of the
      associated master element. The
      <i>IfcFeatureElementSubtraction</i> offers the ability to
      handle shape modifiers as semantic objects within the IFC
      object model that subtract from the shape of the master
      element.

        introduced as an upward compatible extension of the IFC2x
        platform. It is an intermediate abstract supertype
        without defining its own explicit attributes. The
        existing <i>IfcOpeningElement</i> is subtyped from

      <b><u>Containment use definition</u></b>
    </p>
    <p>
      The containment to the spatial structure is defined at the
      level of the supertype <i>IfcFeatureElement</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b><u>Geometry Use Definitions</u></b>
    </p>
    <p>
      The geometric representation of
      <i>IfcFeatureElementSubtraction</i> is given by the
      <i>IfcProductDefinitionShape</i>, allowing multiple
      geometric representations.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Local Placement</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      The local placement for <i>IfcFeatureElementSubtraction</i>
      is defined in its supertype <i>IfcProduct</i>. It is
      defined by the <i>IfcLocalPlacement</i>, which defines the
      local coordinate system that is referenced by all geometric
      representations. The local placement is always defined in
      relation to the local placement of the building element
      from which the feature element is substracted:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>The <i>PlacementRelTo</i> relationship of
      <i>IfcLocalPlacement</i> shall point (if given) to the
      local placement of the same <i>IfcElement</i>, which is
      used in the <i>VoidsElements.RelatingElement</i> inverse
      attribute.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      <b>Shape Representation</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      The geometry use definitions for the shape representation
      of the <i>IfcFeatureElementSubtraction</i> is given at the
      level of its subtypes.
