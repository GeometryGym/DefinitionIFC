      <u>Definition from IAI</u>: An <i>IfcElementQuantity</i>
      defines a set of derived measures of an element's physical
      property. Elements could be spatial structure elements
      (like buildings, storeys, or spaces) or building elements
      (like walls, slabs, finishes). The
      <i>IfcElementQuantity</i> gets assigned to the element by
      using the <i>IfcRelDefinesByProperties</i> relationship.
    </p>
    <p>
      The optional <i>MethodOfMeasurement</i> attribute defines
      the code, e.g. from a standard method of measurement, which
      had been used to calculate the element quantity.
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        <small>NOTE The recognizable values for the name and the
        method of measurement attributes have to be agreed upon
        in further agreement documents, such as implementers
        agreements. Some of these agreements might be limited to
        a certain region, to which the method of measurement
        applies.</small>
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      The name attribute, given at the individual
      <i>Quantities</i> provides a recognizable semantic meaning
      of the element quantity. Both information is needed to
      establish a precise meaning for the measure value. An
      optional description may be assigned to each of the
      <i>Quantities</i>. All quantities assigned by a single
      instance of <i>IfcElementQuantity</i> are deemed to have
      been generated according to the same method of measurement.
      However several instances of <i>IfcElementQuantity</i> are
      assignable to an element, thus allowing for an element
      having quantities generated according to several methods of
      measurement.

        <small>EXAMPLE1 To exchange the net floor area of spaces
        in the German region (as <i>IfcSpace</i>), the name might
        be 'HNF1' (area of main function type 1), and the method
        of measurement might be accordingly 'DIN277' (German
        industry norm no. 277)</small>

    <blockquote>
      <p>
        <small>EXAMPLE2 The same instance of <i>IfcSpace</i> may
        have a different area measure assigned in the German
        region according to a housing regulation, the name would
        be 'Wohnfl&auml;che' and the method of measurement would
        be '2.BV'. It would be attached to the <i>IfcSpace</i> by
        a separate <i>IfcRelDefinesByProperties</i>
        relationship.</small>

    <p>
      The <i>IfcElementQuantity</i> can have the following
      subtypes of <i>IfcPhysicalQuantity</i> within its SET of
      <i>Quantities</i>, which count for the basis measure types
      used:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>count measure
      </li>
      <li>weight measure
      </li>
      <li>length measure
      </li>
      <li>area measure
      </li>
      <li>volume measure
      </li>
      <li>time measure
      </li>
    </ul>
