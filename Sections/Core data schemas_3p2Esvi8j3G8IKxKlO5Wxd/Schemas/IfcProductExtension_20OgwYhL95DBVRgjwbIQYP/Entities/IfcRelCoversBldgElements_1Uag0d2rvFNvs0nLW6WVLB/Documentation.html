    <p>
      <u>Definition from IAI</u>: The <i>IfcRelCoversBldgElements</i>
			is an objectified relationship between an element and 
			one to many coverings, which cover the building element.
    </p>
		<p>Coverings may be defined primarily as coverings of elements,
		like an isolation covers a pipe, or as coverings of spaces, as
		a cladding is often referred to as a space finish.</p>
		<ul>
				<li><i>IfcRelCoversBldgElements</i>, this relationship, 
				expresses the primary relation to the element,</li>
				<li><i>IfcRelCoversSpaces</i> expresses the primary relation
				to the space.</li>
    </ul>
