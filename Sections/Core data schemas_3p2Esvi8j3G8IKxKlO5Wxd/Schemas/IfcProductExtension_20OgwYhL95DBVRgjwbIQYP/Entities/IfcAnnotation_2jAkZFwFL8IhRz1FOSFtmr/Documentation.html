      <u>Definition from IAI</u>: An annotation is a graphical
      representation within the geometric (and spatial) context
      of a project, that adds a note or meaning to the objects
      which constitutes the project model. Annotations include
      additional line drawings, text, dimensioning, hatching and
      other forms of graphical notes.
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        <small>NOTE Additional presentation information (often
        2D) such as tag number, hatching, etc., that is directly
        related to a particular product representation is
        included within the <i>IfcProductDefinitionShape</i>
        having various <i>IfcShapeRepresentation</i>'s of the
        <i>IfcElement</i> (and its subtypes). Only those
        presentation information, that cannot be directly related
        to a single product, have to be wrapped within the
        <i>IfcAnnotation</i>.</small>
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      If available, the annotation should be related to the
      spatial context of the project, by containing the
      annotation within the appropriate level of the building
      structure (site, building, storey, or space). This is
      handled by the <i>IfcRelContainedInSpatialStructure</i>
      relationship.

      <u><b>Geometry Use Definitions</b></u>
    </p>
    <p>
      The geometric representation of any <i>IfcAnnotation</i> is
      given by the <i>IfcProductDefinitionShape</i> and
      <i>IfcLocalPlacement</i> allowing multiple geometric
      representations.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Local Placement</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      The local placement for any <i>IfcAnnotation</i> is defined
      in its supertype <i>IfcProduct</i>. It is defined by the
      <i>IfcLocalPlacement</i>, which defines the local
      coordinate system that is referenced by all geometric
      representations.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>The <i>PlacementRelTo</i> relationship of
      <i>IfcLocalPlacement</i> shall point (if given) to the
      local placement of the same
      <i>IfcSpatialStructureElement</i>, which is used in the <i>
        ContainedInStructure</i> inverse attribute, or to a
        spatial structure element at a higher level, referenced
        by that.
      </li>
      <li>If the relative placement is not used, the absolute
      placement is defined within the world coordinate system.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      <i><b>Geometric Representations</b></i>
    </p>
    <p>
      The standard representation of <i>IfcAnnotation</i> is
      defined using 'GeometricCurveSet' or, when including
      surfaces, the 'GeometricSet' geometry. Styled items adding
      the style information assigned to the geometric
      representation items are grouped together with the
      geometric representation items within the set of
      <i>Items</i> at <i>IfcShapeRepresentation</i>.
