      <u>Definition from IAI</u>: A zone (<i>IfcZone</i>) is an
      aggregation of spaces, partial spaces or other zones. Zone
      structures may not be hierarchical (in contrary to the
      spatial structure of a project - see
      <i>IfcSpatialStructureElement</i>), i.e. one individual
      <i>IfcSpace</i> may be associated with zero, one, or
      several <i>IfcZone</i>'s. <i>IfcSpace</i>'s are aggregated
      into an <i>IfcZone</i> by using the objectified
      relationship <i>IfcRelAssignsToGroup</i> as specified at
      the supertype <i>IfcGroup</i>.
    </p>
    <blockquote>
        <small>NOTE  Certain use cases may restrict the freedom
        of non hierarchical relationships. In some building
        service use cases the zone denotes a view based delimited
        volume for the purpose of analysis and calculation. This
        type of zone cannot overlap with respect to that
        analysis, but may overlap otherwise.</small>
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote>
        <small>NOTE  One of the purposes of a zone is to
        define a fire compartmentation. In this case it defines
        the geometric information about the fire compartment
        (through the contained spaces) and information, whether
        this compartment is ventilated or sprinkler protected. In
        addition the fire risk code and the hazard type can be
        added, the coding is normally defined within a national
        fire regulation. All that information is available within
        the relevant property sets.</small>
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote>
        <small>RECOMMENDATION  In case of a zone
        denoting a (fire) compartment, the following types should
        be used, if applicable, as values of the
        <i>ObjectType</i> attribute:</small>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <small>FireCompartment - a zone of spaces,
          collected to represent a single fire
          compartment.</small>
        </li>
        <li>
          <small>ElevatorShaft - a collection of spaces
          within an elevator, potentially going through many
          storeys.</small>
        </li>
        <li>
          <small>RisingDuct</small>
        </li>
        <li>
          <small>RunningDuct</small>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      Additional classifications of the <i>IfcZone</i>, as
      provided by a national classification system, can be
      assigned by using the <i>IfcRelAssociatesClassification</i>
      relationship.

      The property sets relating to the <i>IfcZone</i> are
      defined by the <i>IfcPropertySet</i> and attached by the
      <i>IfcRelDefinesByProperties</i> relationship. It is
      accessible by the inverse <i>IsDefinedBy</i> relationship.
