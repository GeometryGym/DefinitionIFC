      <u>Definition from IAI</u>: Generalization of all existence
      dependent elements which modify the shape and appearance of
      the associated master element. The <i>IfcFeatureElement</i>
      offers the ability to handle shape modifiers as semantic
      objects within the IFC object model.

        <small>NOTE The term "feature" has a predefined meaning
        in a context of "feature-based modeling" and within steel
        construction work. It is introduced here in a broader
        sense to cover all existence dependent, but semantically
        described, modifiers of an element's shape and
        appearance. It is envisioned that future releases enhance
        the feature-based capabilities of the IFC model.</small>

    <p>
      In contrary to the aggregation, as used in
      <i>IfcElementAssembly</i>, that defines the aggregate as a
      container element, that has equally treated parts, the
      feature concept introduced by <i>IfcFeatureElement</i>
      defines the master element with subordinate parts as
      additions, or with voids or cut-outs as subtractions.

      <b><u>Containment Use Definition</u></b>
    </p>
    <p>
      As a subordinate part being fully dependent on the master
      element the <i>IfcFeatureElement</i> shall have no
      independent containment relationship to the spatial
      structure.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>The <i>SELF\IfcElement.ContainedInStructure</i>
      relationship shall be NIL.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      <b><u>Geometry Use Definition</u></b>
    </p>
    <p>
      The geometric representation of <i>IfcFeatureElement</i> is
      given by the <i>IfcProductDefinitionShape</i>, allowing
      multiple geometric representation.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Local Placement</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      The local placement for <i>IfcFeatureElement</i> is defined
      in its supertype <i>IfcProduct</i>. It is defined by the
      <i>IfcLocalPlacement</i>, which defines the local
      coordinate system that is referenced by all geometric
      representations.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>The <i>PlacementRelTo</i> relationship of
      <i>IfcLocalPlacement</i> shall point (if given) to the
      local placement of the master <i>IfcElement</i> (its
      relevant subtypes), which is associated to the
      <i>IfcFeatureElement</i> by the appropriate relationship
      object.
      </li>
      <li>If the relative placement is not used, the absolute
      placement is defined within the world coordinate system.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      <b>Shape Representation</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      The geometry use definitions for the shape representation
      of the <i>IfcFeatureElement</i> is given at the level of
      its subtypes.
    </p>
