		<u>Definition from IAI</u>: Objectified relationship
		between an <strike>building</strike> element and one opening 
		element that creates a void in the element. It is a one-to-one
		relationship. This relationship implies a Boolean operation of 
		subtraction between the geometric bodies of the element and 
		the opening.
