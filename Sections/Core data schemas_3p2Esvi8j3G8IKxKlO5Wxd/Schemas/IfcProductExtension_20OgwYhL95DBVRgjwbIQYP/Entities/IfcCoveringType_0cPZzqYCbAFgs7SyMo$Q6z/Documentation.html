      <u>Definition from IAI</u>: The <i>IfcCoveringType</i>
      defines a list of commonly shared property set definitions
      of an element and an optional set of product
      representations. It is used to define an element
      specification (i.e. the specific product information, that
      is common to all occurrences of that product type).
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        <small>NOTE The product representations are defined as
        representation maps at the level of the supertype
        <i>IfcTypeProduct</i>, which gets assigned by an element
        occurrence instance through the
        <i>IfcShapeRepresentation.Item[1]</i> being an
        <i>IfcMappedItem</i>.</small>
      </p>

    <p>
      A covering type is used to define the common properties of
      a certain type of a covering that may be applied to many
      instances of that type to assign a specific style. Covering
      types (or the instantiable subtypes) may be exchanged
      without being already assigned to occurrences.
    </p>
    <p>
      The occurrences of the <i>IfcCoveringType</i> are
      represented by instances of <i>IfcCovering</i> (or its
      subtypes).
