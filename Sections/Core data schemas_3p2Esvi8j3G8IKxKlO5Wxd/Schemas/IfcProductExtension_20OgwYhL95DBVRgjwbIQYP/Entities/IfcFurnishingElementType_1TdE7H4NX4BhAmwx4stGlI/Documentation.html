      <u>Definition from IAI</u>: The
      <i>IfcFurnishingElementType</i> defines a list of commonly
      shared property set definitions of an element and an
      optional set of product representations. It is used to
      define an element specification (i.e. the specific product
      information, that is common to all occurrences of that
      product type).
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <small>NOTE  The product representations are defined as
      representation maps (at the level of the supertype
      <i>IfcTypeProduct</i>, which gets assigned by an element
      occurrence instance through the
      <i>IfcShapeRepresentation.Item[1]</i> being an
      <i>IfcMappedItem</i>.</small>

    <p>
      A furnishing element type is used to define the common
      properties of a certain type of a furnishing element that
      may be applied to many instances of that feature type to
      assign a specific style. Furnishing element types (or the
      instantiable subtypes) may be exchanged without being
      already assigned to occurrences.
    </p>
    <p>
      The occurrences of the <i>IfcFurnishingElementType</i> are
      represented by instances of <i>IfcFurnishingElement</i> (or
      its subtypes).
