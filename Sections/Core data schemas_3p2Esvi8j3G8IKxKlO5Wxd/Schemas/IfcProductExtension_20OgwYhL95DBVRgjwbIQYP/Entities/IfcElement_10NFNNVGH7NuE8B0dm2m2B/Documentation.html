      <u>Definition from IAI</u>: Generalization of all
      components that make up an AEC product. Those elements can
      be logically contained by a spatial structure element that
      constitutes a certain level within a project structure
      hierarchy (e.g., site, building, storey or space). This is
      done by using the <i>IfcRelContainedInSpatialStructure</i>
      relationship.
    </p>
    <p>
      Elements are physically existent objects, although they
      might be void elements, such as holes. Elements either
      remain permanently in the AEC product, or only temporarily,
      as formwork does. Elements can be either assembled on site
      or pre-manufactured and built in on site.
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <font size="-1">EXAMPLEs of elements in a building
      construction context are walls, floors, windows and
      recesses.</font>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      An element can have material and quantity information
      assigned through the <i>IfcRelAssociatesMaterial</i> and
      <i>IfcRelDefinesByProperties</i> relationship.
    </p>
    <p>
      In addition an element can be declared to be a specific
      occurrence of an element type (and thereby be defined by
      the element type properties) using the
      <i>IfcRelDefinesByType</i> relationship.
    </p>
    <p>
      An element can also be defined as an element assembly that
      is a group of semantically and topologically related
      elements that form a higher level part of the AEC product.
      Those element assemblies are defined by virtue of the
      <i>IfcRelAggregates</i> relationship.
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <font size="-1">EXAMPLEs for element assembly are complete
      Roof Structures, made by several Roof Areas, or a Stair,
      composed by Flights and Landings.</font>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      Elements that performs the same function may be grouped by
      an "Element Group By Function". It is realized by an
      instance of <i>IfcGroup</i> with the <i>ObjectType</i> =
      'ElementGroupByFunction".

      <u><b>Property Set Use Definition</b></u>:
    </p>
    <p>
      The property sets relating to the <i>IfcElement</i> are
      defined by the <i>IfcPropertySet</i> and attached by the
      <i>IfcRelDefinesByProperties</i> relationship. It is
      accessible by the inverse <i>IsDefinedBy</i> relationship.
      The following property set definitions specific to the
      <i>IfcElement</i> are part of this IFC release:

      <u><b>Quantity Use Definition</b></u>:
    </p>
    <p>
      The quantities relating to the <i>IfcElement</i> are
      defined by the <i>IfcElementQuantity</i> and attached by
      the <i>IfcRelDefinesByProperties</i>. A detailed
      specification for individual quantities is introduced at
      the level of subtypes of <i>IfcElement</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      <u><b>Geometry Use Definitions</b></u>
    </p>
    <p>
      The geometric representation of any <i>IfcElement</i> is
      given by the <i>IfcProductDefinitionShape</i> and
      <i>IfcLocalPlacement</i> allowing multiple geometric
      representations. A detailed specification for the shape
      representation is introduced at the level of subtypes of
      <i>IfcElement</i>.
