      <u>Definition from IAI</u>: The objectified relationship,
      <i>IfcRelCoversSpace</i>, relates a space object to one or
      many coverings, which faces (or is assigned to) the space.
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        <small>NOTE Particularly floorings, ceilings and wall
        coverings, such as claddings or tiling are often
        considered as space coverings, rather then wall or slab
        coverings. In some life cycle phases, such as the
        operation phase, the relationship is always made to the
        space.</small>
      </p>

    <p>
      The IFC specification provides two relationships:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <i>IfcRelCoversBldgElements</i> to assign coverings to
        elements, and
      </li>
      <li>
        <i>IfcRelCoversSpaces</i> to assign coverings to spaces
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Which relationship should be applied has to be determined
      by the context of the project or application .
    </p>

        to use either of the two relationship elements</small>
