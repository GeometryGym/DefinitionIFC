      <u>Definition from IAI</u>: This objectified relationship,
      <i>IfcRelContainedInSpatialStructure</i>, is used to assign
      elements to a certain level of the spatial project
      structure. Any element can only be assigned once to a
      certain level of the spatial structure. The question, which
      level is relevant for which type of element, can only be
      answered within the context of a particular project and
      might vary within the various regions.

        <small>EXAMPLE A multi-storey space is contained (or
        belongs to) the building storey at which its ground level
        is, but it is referenced by all the other building
        storeys, in which it spans. A lift shaft might be
        contained by the basement, but referenced by all storeys,
        through which it spans.</small>

      The containment relationship of an element within a
      spatial structure has to be a hierarchical relationship, an
      element can only be contained within a single spatial
      structure element. The reference relationship between an
      element and the spatial structure may not be hierarchical,
      i.e. an element can reference many spatial structure
      elements.

        <small>NOTE The reference relationship is expressed by
        <i>IfcRelReferencedInSpatialStructure</i>.</small>

    <p>
      Predefined spatial structure elements to which elements can
      be assigned are
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>site as <i>IfcSite</i>
      </li>
      <li>building as <i>IfcBuilding</i>
      </li>
      <li>storey as <i>IfcBuildingStorey</i>
      </li>
      <li>space as <i>IfcSpace</i>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Occurrences of the same element type can be assigned to
      different spatial structure elements depending on the
      context of the occurrence.
