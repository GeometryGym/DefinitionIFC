	 <P>Scheduled and actual durations of a task and all float times should be
		derived within an application from relevant start and finish times that are
		also attributes of this class. Note that they are not directly derived within
		the IFC specification at this stage due to the differences in data type between
		time measures date/time selections.</P> 
	 <P>The critical nature of an <I>IfcScheduleTimeControl</I> may also be
		derived within an application by comparing relevant start and finish date/time
		selections but is not derived within the IFC specification at this stage.</P>
