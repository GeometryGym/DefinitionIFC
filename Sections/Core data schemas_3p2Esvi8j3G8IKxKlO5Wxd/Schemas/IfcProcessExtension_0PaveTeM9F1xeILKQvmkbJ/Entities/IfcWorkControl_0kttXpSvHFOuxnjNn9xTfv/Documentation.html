	 <P>A work control may have resources assigned to it, this is handled by the
		<I>IfcRelAssignsToControl</I> relationship. The assignment of tasks to the work
		control is handled by the <I>IfcRelAssignsTasks</I> relationship.</P> 
	 <P>The inherited attributes have the following meaning:</P> 
	 <P><I>IfcControl.Controls</I> - references to the
		<I>IfcRelAssignsTasks</I>, that assign instances of <I>IfcTask</I> including
		time schedule controls.</P> 
	 <P><I>IfcObject.HasAssignments</I> - references to the
		<I>IfcRelAssignsToResources</I>, that assigns an instance of <I>IfcResource</I>
		to the <I>IfcWorkControl</I>.</P> 
	 <P>The attribute <I>IfcWorkControl.Purpose</I> is used to define the
		purpose of either a work schedule or a work plan. In the case of
		<I>IfcWorkPlan</I>, the purpose attribute can be used to determine if the work
		plan is for cost estimating, task scheduling or some other defined purpose.
