	 <P>An instance of <I>IfcProcedure</I> may nest other instances of
		<I>IfcProcedure</I> using <I>IfcRelNests</I>. Instances of <I>IfcProcedure</I>,
		since they are subtypes of <I>IfcProcess</I>, may also participate in sequence
		relationships using <I>IfcRelSequences</I>. </P> 
	 <P><I>IfcProcedure</I> is used to capture information about stepped
		processes such as calibration, start/stop procedures for equipment items
		etc.</P> 
	 <P>Note that a particular type of <I>IfcProcedure</I> is a caution, warning
		or other form of advisory note. Typically, it is anticipated that such a
		procedure would be assigned to the specific <I>IfcProcess</I> for which it gives
		advice using <I>IfcRelAssignsToProcess</I>.</P> 
	 <P>Note that both nesting and sequencing can be supported concurrently. For
		example, B, C and D may be procedures nested in procedure A. Sequence
		relationships can also be established such that B precedes C and C precedes
		D.</P>
