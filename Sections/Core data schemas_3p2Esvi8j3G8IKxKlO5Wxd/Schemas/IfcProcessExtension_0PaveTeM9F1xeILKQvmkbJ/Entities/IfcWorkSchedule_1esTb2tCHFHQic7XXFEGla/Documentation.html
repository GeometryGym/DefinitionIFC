	 <P>An <I>IfcWorkSchedule</I> includes a set of elements (created through
		relating schedule time controls to tasks) with references to the resources used
		for the tasks included in the work schedule. Additionally, through the
		<I>IfcWorkControl</I> abstract supertype, the actors creating the schedule can
		be specified and schedule time information such as start time, finish time, and
		total float of the schedule can also be specified. </P> 
	 <P><I>IfcWorkSchedule</I> can reference a project (i.e. the single
		<I>IfcProject</I> instance). The documents of the <I>IfcWorkSchedule</I> can be
		referenced by the <I>IfcRelAssociatesDocuments</I> relationship. Moreover, a
		work schedule can include other work schedules as sub-items through
		<I>IfcRelNests</I> relationship. </P>
