	 <P><U>Definition from IAI: </U>An <I>IfcTask</I> is an identifiable unit of
		work to be carried out independently of any other units of work in a
		construction project. </P> 
	 <BLOCKQUOTE> <FONT COLOR="#0000FF" SIZE="-1">HISTORY: New entity in IFC
		Release 1.0. Renamed from IfcWorkTask in IFC 2x.</FONT></BLOCKQUOTE> 
	 <P><U>Use Definitions</U></P> 
	 <P>Work is identified as tasks (i.e. <I>IfcTask</I>) that are capable of
		either containing other tasks or being sub-items of other tasks. A task can be
		used to describe a process for the construction or installation of
		products.</P> 
	 <P>Each instance of <I>IfcTask</I> is given a name that is indicative of
		its content. A textual description of the the task may be be provided.</P> 
	 <P>Instances of <I>IfcTask</I> may be assigned to an <I>IfcWorkControl</I>
		(either a work plan or a work schedule) through the <I>IfcRelAssignsTasks</I>
		relationship class.</P> 
	 <P>The installation of a number of items of equipment within a particular
		space may be the subject of a single task which is identified as e.g. &#145;fix
		equipment in space 123&#146;. <I>IfcTask</I> represents the occurrence of a
		work performance of a type of process in a construction plan. </P> 
	 <P>A task can nest other tasks as sub-items; the nesting relationship is
		modeled by <I>IfcRelNests</I>. For example, the
		construction of a stud wall may be designated as a nesting task named
		&#145;install wall #1&#146; including other tasks such as &#145;install dry
		wall&#146;, &#145;install studs&#146;, &#145;wall taping&#146;, and &#145;erect
		wall&#146; as sub-processes. </P> 
	 <P>Special information relating to a task is asserted using
		<I>IfcTask.ObjectType</I> (inherited from <I>IfcObject</I>). Examples that may
		be used include fixed duration, fixed unit, fixed work.</P> 
	 <P>The sequential relationships between tasks are represented by
		<I>IfcRelSequence</I> in <I>IfcKernel</I> schema. </P> 
	 <P>Resource used by tasks are assigned by <I>IfcRelAssignsToProcess</I>.
		Quantities of resources consumed by the task are dealt with by defining the
		<I>IfcElementQuantity</I> for the resource and not at the instance of
		<I>IfcTask</I>.</P> 
	 <P>An <I>IfcTask</I> may be assigned a Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) code.
		A WBS code is dealt with as a classification of task and is associated to a
		task occurrence using the <I>IfcRelAssociatesClassification</I> relationship
		class. As well as being to designate the code, the classification structure of
		the IFC model also enables the source of the work breakdown structure
		classification to be identified.</P>
