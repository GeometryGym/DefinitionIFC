	 <H2>Introduction</H2> 
	 <P>The <I>IfcProcessExtension</I> schema provides the primary information
		that expands one of the key ideas of the IFC Model. This is the idea of
		'process' which captures ideas about the planning and scheduling of work and
		the tasks and procedures required for its completion. It is important to
		understand that process information can be expressed by classes in exactly the
		same way as product information. A process can also have state and identity,
		the state being determined by the values of various attributes of the
		processes.</P> 
	 <H2>Scope</H2> 
	 <P>The <I>IfcProcessExtension</I> schema extends the primary idea of the
		<I>IfcProcess</I> outlined in the <I>IfcKernel</I> schema. The objective of the
		<I>IfcProcessExtension</I> schema is to capture information that supports the
		planning and scheduling of work and the procedures and resources required to
		carry out work. The aim is to provide support for information exchange and
		sharing within commonly used scheduling applications; the extent of the model
		will not support the more detailed ideas found in more specialized scheduling
		applications.</P> 
	 <P>The following are within the scope of this part of the
		specifications:</P> 
	 <UL> 
		<LI>definition of work plans including the tasks that are included within
		  the plan and identification of the resources required by the plan,</LI> 
		<LI>definition of work schedules together with the elements that make up
		  the schedule, the time constraints and durations applicable to the
		  elements,</LI> 
		<LI>identification of work tasks included in plans and schedules,</LI> 
		<LI>identification of procedures that are considered to not consume time
		  in their accomplishment,</LI> 
		<LI>identification of the relationship between a process and the
		  resources that are consumed by the process,</LI> 
		<LI>allocation of resources to work plans, work schedules and work
		  tasks.</LI>
