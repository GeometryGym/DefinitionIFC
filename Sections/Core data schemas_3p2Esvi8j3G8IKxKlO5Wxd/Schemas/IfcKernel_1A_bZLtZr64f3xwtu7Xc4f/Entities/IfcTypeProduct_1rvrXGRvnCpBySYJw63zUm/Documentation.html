		defines a list of property set definitions of a product and an optional set of
		product representations. It is used to define a product specification (i.e. the
		specific product information, that is common to all occurrences of that product
		type).</P>

	 <P>A product type is used to define the common properties of a certain type
		or style of an object that may be applied to instances of those products to
		assign a specific style to them. Product types may be exchanges without being
		already assigned to products.</P>
