	 <P><U>Definition from IAI</U>: The abstract generalization of all
		objectified relationships in IFC. Objectified relationships are the preferred
		way to handle relationships among objects. This allows to keep relationship
		specific properties directly at the relationship and opens the possibility to
		later handle relationship specific behavior. </P> 
	 <P>There are two different types of relationships, 1-to-1 relationships and
		1-to-many relationship. used within the subtypes of <I>IfcRelationship</I>. The
		following convention applies to all subtypes:</P> 
	 <UL> 
		<LI>The two sides of the objectified relationship are named <BR>-
		  Relating+&lt;name of relating object&gt; and <BR>- Related+&lt;name of related
		  object&gt;</LI> 
		<LI>In case of the 1-to-many relationship, the related side of the
		  relationship shall be an aggregate SET 1:N</LI>
