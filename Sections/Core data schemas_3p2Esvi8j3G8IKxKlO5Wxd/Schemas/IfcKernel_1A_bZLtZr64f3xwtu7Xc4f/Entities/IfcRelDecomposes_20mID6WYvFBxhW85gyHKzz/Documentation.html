	 <P><U>Definition from IAI</U>: The decomposition relationship,
		<I>IfcRelDecomposes</I>, defines the general concept of elements being composed
		or decomposed. The decomposition relationship denotes a whole/part hierarchy
		with the ability to navigate from the whole (the composition) to the parts and
		vice versa.</P>
	 <P>Decompositions may be constraint by requiring both, the whole and its
		parts, to be of the same type - thus establishing a nesting relationship. Or
		they may require some form of physical containment, thus establishing special
		types of aggregation relationships.</P> 
	 <BLOCKQUOTE><FONT SIZE="-1"> NOTE: There are two special names for
		decomposition, which are linguistically distinguished, nesting and aggregation.
		The subtypes of <I>IfcRelDecomposes</I> will introduce either the nesting or
		aggregation convention (see <I>IfcRelNests</I> and
		<I>IfcRelAggregates</I>).</FONT></BLOCKQUOTE> 
	 <BLOCKQUOTE><FONT SIZE="-1"> EXAMPLE: A cost element is a nest of other
		cost elements. Or a structural frame is an aggregation of beams and columns.
		Both are applications of decomposition relationship.</FONT></BLOCKQUOTE>
	 <P>Decompositions imply a dependency, i.e. the definition of the whole
		depends on the definition of the parts and the parts depend on the existence of
		the whole. The decomposition relationship can be applied in a recursive manner,
		i.e. a decomposed element can be part in another decomposition. Cyclic
		references have to be prevented at application level.</P>
