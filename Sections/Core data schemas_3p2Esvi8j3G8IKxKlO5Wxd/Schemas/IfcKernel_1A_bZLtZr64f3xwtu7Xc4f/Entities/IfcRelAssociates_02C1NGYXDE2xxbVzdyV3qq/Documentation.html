	 <P><U>Definition from IAI</U>: The association relationship
		(<I>IfcRelAssociates</I>) refer to external sources of information (most
		notably a classification, library or document). There is no dependency implied
		by the association.</P> 
	 <BLOCKQUOTE><FONT SIZE="-1">EXAMPLE: Further information may the given to
		the tank equipment (as subtype of <I>IfcProduct</I>) in terms of its
		classification and instruction documents, the source of the additional
		information is held external to the IFC project model. </FONT></BLOCKQUOTE> 
	 <P>Association relationships can the established to objects (occurrences) or
		to types (both object types, <I>IfcTypeObject</I>, or partial types,
		<I>IfcPropertySetDefinition</I>).</P> 
	 <BLOCKQUOTE><FONT SIZE="-1">EXAMPLE 1: The classification information for
		the tank equipment may be associated to the <I>IfcTypeProduct</I> (subtype of
		<I>IfcTypeObject</I>), defining the specific information for all occurrences of
		that tank in the project. Therefore the association of the (e.g.) Uniclass
		notation 'L6814' may be associated by a subtype of <I>IfcRelAssociates</I> to
		the type information.</FONT></BLOCKQUOTE> 
	 <BLOCKQUOTE><FONT SIZE="-1">EXAMPLE 2: The classification information for a
		particular space within a building may the associated to the <I>IfcSpace</I>
		object (subtype of <I>IfcObject</I>), defining a particular occurrence of
		space. Therefore the association of the (e.g.) DIN notation 'HNF 1.5' may be
		associated by a subtype of <I>IfcRelAssociates</I> to the
		object.</FONT></BLOCKQUOTE> 
	 <P>The association relationship establishs a uni-directional association.
		The subtypes of <I>IfcRelAssociates</I> establishes the particular semantic
