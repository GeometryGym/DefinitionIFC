	 <P><U>Definition from IAI</U>: This objectified relationship
		(<I>IfcRelAssignsToProcess</I>) handles the assignment of an object as an item
		the process operates on. Process is related to the product that it operate on
		(normally as input or output) through this relationship. Processes can operate
		on things other than products, and can operate in ways other than input and
		output. </P> 
	 <BLOCKQUOTE><U>Example</U>, it may be common to define processes during
		estimating or scheduling that describe design tasks (resulting in documents),
		procurement tasks (resulting in construction materials), planning tasks
		(resulting in processes), etc. Furthermore, the ways in which process can
		operate on something might include "installs", "finishes", "transports",
		"removes", etc. The ways are described as operation types.</BLOCKQUOTE> 
	 <P>The inherited attribute <I>RelatedObjects</I> gives the references to
		the objects, which the process operates on. The <I>RelatingProcess</I> is the
		process, that operates on the object. The operation types are captured in the
		inherited attribute <I>Name</I>.</P>
