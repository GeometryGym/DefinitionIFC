	 <P><U>Definition from IAI</U>: This objectified relationship
		(<I>IfcRelDefinesByProperties</I>) defines the relationships between property
		set definitions and objects. Properties are aggregated in property sets,
		property sets can be grouped to define an object type.</P> 
	 <P> The <I>IfcRelDefinesByProperties</I> is a 1-to-N relationship, as it
		allows for the assignment of one property set to a single or to many objects.
		Those objects then share the same property definition.</P>
