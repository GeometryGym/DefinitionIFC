	 <P><U>Definition from IAI</U>: This objectified relationship
		(<I>IfcRelAssignsToGroup</I>) handles the assignment of objects (subtypes of
		<I>IfcObject</I>) to a group (subtypes of <I>IfcGroup</I>).</P>
	 <P>The relationship handles the assignment of group members to the group
		object. It allows for grouping arbitrary objects within a group, including
		other groups. The grouping relationship can be applied in a recursive manner.
		The resulting group is of type <I>IfcGroup</I>. The <I>Purpose</I> attribute
		defined at the supertype IfcReleationship, may assign a descriptor, that
		defines the purpose of the group.</P> 
	 <P>The inherited attribute <I>RelatedObjects</I> gives the references to
		the objects, which are the elements within the group. The <I>RelatingGroup</I>
		is the group, that comprises all elements. </P> 
	 <P><U>Informal proposition</U>:</P> 
	 <OL> 
		<LI>The group assignment relationship shall be a-cyclic, i.e. a group
		  should not participate in its own grouping relationship.</LI>
