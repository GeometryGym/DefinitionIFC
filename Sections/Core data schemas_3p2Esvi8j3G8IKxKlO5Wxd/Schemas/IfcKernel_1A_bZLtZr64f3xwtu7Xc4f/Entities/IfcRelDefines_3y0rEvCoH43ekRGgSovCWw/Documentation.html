	 <P><U>Definition from IAI</U>: A definition relationship
		(<I>IfcRelDefines</I>) that uses a type definition or property set definition
		(seens as partial type information) to define the properties of the object
		instance. It is a specific - occurrence relationship with implied dependencies
		(as the occurrence properties depend on the specific properties).</P> 
	 <P>The <I>IfcRelDefines</I> relationship establishes the link between one
		type (specific) information and several objects (occurrences). Those
		occurrences then share the same type (or partial type) information.</P>
	 <BLOCKQUOTE><FONT SIZE="-1">EXAMPLE: Several instances of windows within
		the IFC project model may be of the same (catalogue or manufacturer) type.
		Thereby they share the same properties. This relationship is established by a
		subtype of the <I>IfcRelDefines</I> relationship assigning an
		<I>IfcProductType</I> (or subtype thereof) to the
		<I>IfcWindow</I>.</FONT></BLOCKQUOTE>
