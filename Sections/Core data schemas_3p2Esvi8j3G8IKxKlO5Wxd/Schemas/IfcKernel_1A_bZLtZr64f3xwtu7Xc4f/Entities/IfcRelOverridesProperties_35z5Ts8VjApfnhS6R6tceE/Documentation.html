	 <P><U>Definition from IAI</U>: The objectified relationship
		(<I>IfcRelOverridesProperties</I>) defines the relationships between objects
		and a standard property set. It also defines a set of properties, which values
		override the standard values given within the standard property set.</P> 
	 <P>The inherited attributes should be interpreted as follows:</P> 
	 <UL> 
		<LI><I>SELF\IfcRelDefinedByProperties.RelatingPropertyDefinition</I>:
		  Property set, which defines the standard set of properties assigned to all
		  objects, that have the same set of properties,</LI> 
		<LI><I>SELF\IfcRelDefines.RelatedObjects</I>: An object occurrence, to
		  which the same set of properties is applied. The object is characterized that
		  certain property values, given by the standard set of properties, have a
		  different value than those defined for all objects of the same style,</LI> 
		<LI><I>OverridingProperties</I>: A set of properties, that have a
		  different value for the subset of objects. The set of the individual overriding
		  properties have to correspond with a standard property set and its containing
		  properties, as given by the <I>RelatingPropertyDefinition</I> attribute. The
		  correspondence is established by the <I>Name</I> attribute.</LI> 
	 </UL> 
	 <P>It is provided as specialization of <I>IfcRelDefinedByProperties</I>
		relationship. </P>

		  names of the properties in the set of overriding properties and the names of
		  the properties whose values are to be changed in the base property set. In
		  addition the inherited attribute RelatingPropertyDefinition points to the
		  property set which values are overridden.</FONT></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
