<p><u>Definition from IAI</u>: The <i>IfcPropertySet</i>
defines all dynamically extensible properties. The property set is a
container class that holds properties within a property tree. These
properties are interpreted according to their name attribute. </p>
<p>Property sets, defining a particular type of object, can be
assigned an object type (<i>IfcTypeObject</i>). Property
sets are assigned to objects (<i>IfcObject</i>) through an
objectified relationship (<i>IfcRelDefinedByProperties</i>).
If the same set of properties applies to more than one object, it
should be assigned by a single instance of <i>IfcRelDefinedByProperties</i>
to a set of related objects. Those property sets are referred to as
shared property sets.</p>

<p><b>Use Definition</b></p>
<p>Instances of <i>IfcPropertySet</i> are used to
assign named sets of individual properties (complex or single
properties). Each individual property has a significant name string.
Some property sets have&nbsp;predefined instructions on assigning
those significant name, these are listed under "property sets" main
menu item within this specification. The naming convention "Pset_Xxx"
applies to those property sets and shall be used as the value to the <i>Name</i>
attribute.</p>
<p>In addition any user defined property set can be captured,
those property sets shall have a <i>Name</i> value not
including the "Pset_" prefix.</p>
