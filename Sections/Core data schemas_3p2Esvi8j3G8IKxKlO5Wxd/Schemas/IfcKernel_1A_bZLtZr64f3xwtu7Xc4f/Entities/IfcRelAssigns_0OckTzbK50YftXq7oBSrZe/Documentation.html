	 <P><U>Definition from IAI</U>: The assignment relationship,
		<I>IfcRelAssigns</I>, is a generalization of "link" relationships among
		instances of IfcObject and its various 1<SUP>st</SUP> level subtypes. A link
		denotes the specific association through which one object (the client) applies
		the services of other objects (the suppliers), or through which one object may
		navigate to other objects.</P>
	 <P>The client is denoted as the relating object and is established at the
		level of the specific, instantiable subtypes of <I>IfcRelAssigns</I>. The
		suppliers are denoted as the related objects and they are established by the
		<I>RelatedObjects</I> attribute.</P> 
	 <BLOCKQUOTE><FONT SIZE="-1">NOTE: The terms "client" and "supplier" are
		used in a general concept and do not imply any meaning for implementations of
		systems (like client-server).</FONT></BLOCKQUOTE>
	 <BLOCKQUOTE><FONT SIZE="-1">EXAMPLE: A resource may receive information
		about its nature of representing real building products by establishing a link
		between <I>IfcResource</I> and <I>IfcBuildingElement</I> (subtype of
		<I>IfcProduct</I>) throught he assignment relationship
		<I>IfcRelAssignsToResource</I>. The resource is then the client that applies
		the services of other objects (here building elements) to express the
		particular view of elements to be consumed as a resource in a
		process.</FONT></BLOCKQUOTE>
	 <P>The assignment relationship establishs a bi-directional relationship
		among the participating objects and does not imply any dependency. The subtypes
		of IfcRelAssigns establishes the particular semantic meaning of the assignment
		relationship.</P>
