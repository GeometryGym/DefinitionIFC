<p>Definition from IAI: The <i>IfcGroup</i> is an
generalization of any arbitrary group. A group is a logical collection
of objects. It does not have its own position, nor can it hold its own
shape representation. Therefore a group is an aggregation under some
non-geometrical / topological grouping aspects. </p>
<blockquote>
  <small>NOTE&nbsp; Use <i>IfcRelDecomposes</i>
together with the appropriate subtypes of <i>IfcProduct</i>
to define an aggregation of products that may have its own position and
shape representation.<br>
EXAMPLE&nbsp; An example for a group
is the system, since it groups elements under the aspect of their role,
regardless of their position in a building.</small>
</blockquote>
<p>A group can hold any collection of objects
(being&nbsp;products, processes,
controls, resources, actors or other groups). Thus groups can be
nested. An object can be part of zero, one, or many groups. Grouping
relationships are not required to be hierarchical.</p>
<blockquote>
  <small>NOTE&nbsp; Use <i>IfcRelDecomposes</i>
together with the appropriate subtypes of <i>IfcProduct</i>
to define an hierarchical aggregation of products.</small>
</blockquote>
<p>The group collection is handled by an instance of <i>IfcRelAssignsToGroup</i>,
which assigns all group members to the <i>IfcGroup</i>.</p>
