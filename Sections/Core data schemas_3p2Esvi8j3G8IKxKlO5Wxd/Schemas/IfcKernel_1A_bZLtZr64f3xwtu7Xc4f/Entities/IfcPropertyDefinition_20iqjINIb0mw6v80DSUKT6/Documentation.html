<p><u>Definition from IAI</u>: The <i>IfcPropertyDefinition</i>
defines the generalization of all characteristics (i.e. a grouping of
individual properties), that may be assigned to objects. Currently,
subtypes of <i>IfcPropertyDefinition</i> include property
set definitions, and property sets.. </p>
<p>Property definitions define information that is shared among
multiple instances of objects. The assignment of the shared information
to objects is handled by the <i>IfcRelDefines</i>
relationship.</p>
