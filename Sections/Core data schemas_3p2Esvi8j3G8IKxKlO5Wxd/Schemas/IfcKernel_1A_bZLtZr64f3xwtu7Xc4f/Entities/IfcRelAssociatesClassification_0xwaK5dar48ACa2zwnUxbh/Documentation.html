	 <P><U>Definition from IAI</U>: This objectified relationship
		(<I>IfcRelAssociatesClassification</I>) handles the assignment of a
		classification object (items of the select <I>IfcClassificationSelect</I>) to
		objects (subtypes of <I>IfcObject</I>).</P> 
	 <P>The relationship is used to assign a classification notation or a
		classification reference to objects. A single notation can be applied to
		multiple objects. Depending on the type of the <I>RelatingClassification</I>,
		either a reference to a fully described classification system can be made, or
		just a reference using the classification code.</P>
	 <P>The inherited attribute <I>RelatedObjects</I> define the objects to
		which the classification is applied. The attribute
		<I>RelatingClassification</I> is the reference to a classification, applied to
		the object(s).</P>
