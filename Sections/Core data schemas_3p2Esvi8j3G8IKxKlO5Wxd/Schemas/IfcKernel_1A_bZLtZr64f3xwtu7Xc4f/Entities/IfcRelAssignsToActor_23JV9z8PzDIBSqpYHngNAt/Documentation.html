	 <P><U>Definition from IAI</U>: This objectified relationship
		(<I>IfcRelAssignsToActor</I>) handles the assignment of objects (subtypes of
		<I>IfcObject</I>) to an actor (subtypes of <I>IfcActor</I>).</P>
	 <P>The <I>IfcRelAssignsToActor</I> objectified relationship defines a
		relationship between an <I>IfcActor</I> and one or many objects. An particular
		role of the actor played in that relationship can be associated. If specified,
		it takes priority over the role that may be directly assigned to the person or
		organization.</P>
	 <BLOCKQUOTE><U>Example</U>: An occupant (as an actor) may rent (as a
		special association type) a flat (as a collection of spaces or a zone). This
		would be an application of this generic relationship.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	 <P>Reference to the objects (or single object) on which the actor acts upon
		in a certain role (if given) is specified in the inherited
		<I>RelatedObjects</I> attribute. </P>
