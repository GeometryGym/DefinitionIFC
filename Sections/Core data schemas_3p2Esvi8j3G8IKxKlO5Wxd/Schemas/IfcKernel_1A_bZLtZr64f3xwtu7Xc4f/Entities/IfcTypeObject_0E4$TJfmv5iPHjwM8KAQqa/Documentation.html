	 <P><U>Definition from IAI</U>: The object type (<I>IfcTypeObject</I>)
		defines the specific information about a type. It refers to the specific level
		of the well recognized <I>generic - specific - occurrence</I> modeling
		paradigm.</P> 
	 <P>The object style is represented by a list of property set definitions,
		where the order in the list implies a decreasing generality. The list of
		property sets describes the available specific information about the object
		type. Thereby the object type is used to define the common properties of a
		certain type (or style) of an object that may be applied to multiple instances
		of the same type. The <I>IfcTypeObject</I> gets assigned to the individual
		object instances (the occurrences) via the <I>IfcRelDefinesByType</I>
		relationship.</P> 
	 <P>Object types may be exchanged without being already assigned to objects.
		An object type may have an indication of the library (or catalogue) from which
		its definition originates. This association is handled by the inherited
		<I>HasAssociations</I> relationship.</P>
