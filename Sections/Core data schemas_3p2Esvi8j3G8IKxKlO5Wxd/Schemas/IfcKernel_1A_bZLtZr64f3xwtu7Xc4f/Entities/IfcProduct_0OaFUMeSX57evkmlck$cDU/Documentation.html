<p><u>Definition from IAI</u>: Any object, or any aid
to define, organize and annotate an object, that relates to a geometric
or spatial context. Subtypes of <i>IfcProduct</i> usually
hold a shape representation and a local placement within the project
structure. </p>
<p>This includes manufactured, supplied or created objects
(referred to as elements) for incorporation into an AEC/FM project.
This also includes objects that are created indirectly by other
products, as spaces are defined by bounding elements. Products can be
designated for permanent use or temporary use, an example for the
latter is formwork. Products are defined by their properties and
representations.</p>
<p>In addition to physical products (covered by the subtype <i>IfcElement</i>)
and spatial items (covered by the subtype <i>IfcSpatialStructureElement</i>)
the <i>IfcProduct</i> also includes non-physical items,
that relate to a geometric or spatial contexts, such as grid, port,
annotation, structural actions, etc.</p>

<p><b>Use Definition</b></p>
<p>Any instance of <i>IfcProduct</i> defines a
particular occurrence of a product, the common type information, that
relates to many similar (or identical) occurrences of <i>IfcProduct</i>,
is handled by the <i>IfcTypeProduct</i> (and its
subtypes), assigned to one or many occurrences of <i>IfcProduct</i>
by using the objectified relationship <i>IfcRelDefinesByType</i>.
The <i>IfcTypeProduct</i> may provide, in addition to
common properties, also a common geometric representation for all
occurrences.</p>
<p>An <i>IfcProduct</i> occurs at a specific
location in space if it has a geometric representation assigned. It can
be placed relatively to other products, but ultimately relative to the
world coordinate system defined for this project.</p>
<p>The inherited <i>ObjectType</i> attribute can be
used to designate a particular type of the product instance. If
subtypes of <i>IfcProduct</i> have a <i>PredefinedType</i>
defined, the <i>ObjectType</i> is used to provide the user
defined, particular type of the product instance, if the <i>PredefinedType</i>
is set to <font size="-1">USERDEFINED</font>.</p>
