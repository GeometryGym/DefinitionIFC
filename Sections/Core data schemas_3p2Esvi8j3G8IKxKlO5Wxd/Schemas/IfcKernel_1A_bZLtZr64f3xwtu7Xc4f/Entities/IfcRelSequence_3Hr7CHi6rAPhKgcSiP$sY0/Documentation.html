	 <P><U>Definition from IAI</U>: This objectified relationship handles the
		concatenation of processes over time. The sequence is defined as relationship
		between two processes. The related object is the successor of the relating
		object, being the predecessor. A time lag is assigned to a sequence, and the
		sequence type defines the way in which the time lag applies to the sequence.
		</P> 
	 <P><I>IfcRelSequence</I> is defined as an one-to-one relationship,
		therefore it assigns one predecessor to one successor. However, each
		<I>IfcProcess</I> can have multiple predecessors and successors, as the
		sequence relationship is truly an N-to-M relationship. </P>
