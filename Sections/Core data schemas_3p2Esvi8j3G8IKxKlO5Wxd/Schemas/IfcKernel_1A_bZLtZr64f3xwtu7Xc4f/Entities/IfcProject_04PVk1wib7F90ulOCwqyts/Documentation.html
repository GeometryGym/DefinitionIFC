<p><u>Definition from IAI</u>: The undertaking of
some design, engineering, construction, or maintenance activities
leading towards a product. The project establishes the context for
information to be exchanged or shared, and it may represent a
construction project but does not have to. </p>
<p>The representation context, in the case of a geometric
representation context, which is referenced from the <i>IfcProject</i>,
includes:</p>
<ul>
  <li>the default units used</li>
  <li>the world coordinate system</li>
  <li>the coordinate space dimension</li>
  <li>the precision used within the geometric representations, and</li>
  <li>optionally the indication of the true north relative to the
world coordinate system</li>
</ul>

<p><u><b>Property Set Use Definition</b></u>:</p>
<p>The property sets relating to the <i>IfcProject</i>
are defined by the <i>IfcPropertySet</i> and attached by
the <i>IfcRelDefinesByProperties</i> relationship. It is
accessible by the inverse <i>IsDefinedBy</i> relationship.
The following property set definitions specific to the <i>IfcProject</i>
are part of this IFC release:</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="../../psd/IfcKernel/Pset_ProjectCommon.xml"
 target="SOURCE">Pset_ProjectCommon</a>: common
property set for the single project occurrence.</li>
</ul>
<p><u><b>Spatial Structure Use Definition</b></u></p>
<p>The <i>IfcProject</i>
is used to reference the root of&nbsp;the spatial structure of a
building (that serves as
the primary project breakdown and is required to be hierarchical). The
spatial structure elements are linked together, and to the <i>IfcProject</i>,
by using the objectified
relationship <i>IfcRelAggregates</i>.
The <i>IfcProject</i> references them
by its inverse relationship:</p>
<ul>
  <li><i>IfcProject.Decomposes</i>
-- referencing (<i>IfcSite</i> || <i>IfcBuilding</i>)
by <i>IfcRelAggregates.RelatingObject</i>. The IfcSite or
IfcBuilding referenced shall be the root of the spatial structure.</li>
  <li><i>IfcProject.IsDecomposedBy</i>
-- it shall be NIL, i.e. the <i>IfcProject</i> shall not
be decomposed into any parts.</li>
</ul>
<u>Informal propositions</u>:
<ol>
  <li>There shall only be one project within the exchange
context. This is enforced by the global rule <i>IfcSingleProjectInstance</i>.</li>
</ol>
