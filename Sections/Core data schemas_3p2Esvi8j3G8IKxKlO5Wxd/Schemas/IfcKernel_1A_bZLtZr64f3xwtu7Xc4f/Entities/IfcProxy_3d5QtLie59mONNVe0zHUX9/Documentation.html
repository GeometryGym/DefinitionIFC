<p><u>Definition from IAI</u>: The <i>IfcProxy</i>
is intended to be a kind of a container for wrapping objects which are
defined by associated properties, which may or may not have a geometric
representation and placement in space. A proxy may have a semantic
meaning, defined by the <i>Name</i> attribute, and
property definitions, attached through the property assignment
relationship, which definition may be outside of the definitions given
by the current release of IFC.</p>
<p>The <i>ProxyType</i> may give an indication to
which high level semantic breakdown of object the semantic definition
of the proxy relates to. the <i>Tag</i> attribute may be
used to assign a human or system interpretable identifier (such as a
serial number or bar code).</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><small>NOTE 1&nbsp; Given that only a
limited number of semantic constructs can be formally defined within
IFC (and it will never be possible to define all), there has to be a
mechanism for capturing those constructs that are not (yet) defined by
IFC. <br>
  <br>
NOTE 2&nbsp; Product proxies are a
mechanism that allows to exchange data that is part of the project but
not necessarily part of the IFC model. Those proxies may have geometric
representations assigned.</small></p>
