<p><u>Definition from IAI</u>: The <i>IfcControl</i>
is the abstract generalization of all concepts that control or
constrain products or processes in general. It can be seen as a
specification, regulation, cost schedule or other requirement applied
to a product or process whose requirements and provisions must be
fulfilled. Controls are assigned to products, processes, or other
objects by using the <i>IfcRelAssignsToControl</i>
relationship.</p>
<blockquote>
  <small>EXAMPLE&nbsp; Controls are e.g.,
space program, cost schedules, order, work plan, etc.<br>
NOTE&nbsp; Some basic items,
such as cost value, approval, or constraint are directly attachable to
products and processes using the association relationship subtypes of <i>IfcRelAssociates</i>.</small></blockquote>
