<p><u>Definition from IAI</u>: An <i>IfcPropertySetDefinition</i>
is a generalization of property sets, that are either: </p>
<blockquote>
  <p><b>Dynamically extendable properties</b>, they
define properties for which the IFC model only provides a kind of "meta
model", to be further declared by agreement. This means no entity
definition of the properties exists within the IFC model. The
declaration is done by assigning a significant string value to
the&nbsp;<i>Name</i> attribute of the entity as defined
in the entity <i>IfcPropertySet</i> and at each subtype of
  <i>IfcProperty</i>, referenced by the property set.</p>
  <p><b>Statically defined properties</b>, they
define properties for which an entity definition exists within the IFC
model. The semantic meaning of each statically defined property is
declared by its entity type and the meaning of the properties is
defined by the name of the explicit attribute.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The subtypes of the <i>IfcPropertySetDefinition</i>
are either the dynamically extendable <i>IfcPropertySet</i>,
or all other statically defined subtypes.</p>
