<p><u>Definition from IAI</u>: An <i>IfcObject</i>
is the generalization of any semantically treated thing or process.
Objects are things as they appear - i.e. occurrences. </p>
<blockquote><font size="-1"> NOTE Examples of <i>IfcObject</i>
include physically tangible items, such as wall, beam or covering,
physically existing items, such as spaces, or conceptual items, such as
grids or virtual boundaries. It also stands for processes, such as work
tasks, for controls, such as cost items, for actors, such as persons
involved in the design process, etc. </font></blockquote>
<p>Objects can be named, using the inherited <i>Name</i>
attribute, which should be a user recognizable label for the object
occurrence. Further explanations to the object can be given using the
inherited <i>Description</i> attribute. The <i>ObjectType</i>
attribute is used:</p>
<ul>
  <li>to store the user defined value for all subtypes of <i>IfcObject</i>,
where a <i>PredefinedType</i> attribute is given, and its
value is set to USERDEFINED.</li>
  <li>to provide a type information (could be seen as a very
lightweight classifier) of the subtype of <i>IfcObject</i>,
if no <i>PredefinedType</i> attribute is given. This is
often the case, if no comprehensive list of predefined types is
available.</li>
</ul>
<p>Objects are independent pieces of information that might
contain or reference other pieces of information. There are four
essential kind of relationships in which objects can be involved:</p>
<ul>
  <li><b>Assignment of other objects</b> - an
assignment relationship that refers to other types of objects. See
supertype <i>IfcObjectDefinition</i> for more information.</li>
  <li><b>Association to external resources</b> - an
association relationship that refers to external sources of
information.&nbsp;See supertype <i>IfcObjectDefinition</i>
for more information.</li>
  <li><b>Aggregation of other objects</b> - an
aggregation relationship that establishes a whole/part relation. See
supertype <i>IfcObjectDefinition</i> for more information.<br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li><b>Refinement by type and properties</b> - a
refinement relationship (<i>IfcRelDefines</i>) that uses a
type definition or (partial) property set definition to define the
properties of the object instance. It is a specific - occurrence
relationship with implied dependencies (as the occurrence properties
depend on the specific properties).</li>
</ul>
