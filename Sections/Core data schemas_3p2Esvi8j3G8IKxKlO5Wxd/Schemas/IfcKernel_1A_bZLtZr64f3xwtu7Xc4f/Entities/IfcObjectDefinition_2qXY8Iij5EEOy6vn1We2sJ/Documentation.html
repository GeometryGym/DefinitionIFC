<p><u>Definition
from IAI</u>: An <i>IfcObjectDefinition</i>
is the generalization of any semantically treated thing or process,
either being a type or an occurrences. Object defintions can be named,
using the inherited <i>Name</i>
attribute, which should be a user recognizable label for the object
occurrence. Further explanations to the object can be given using the
inherited <i>Description</i>
attribute.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Objects are independent pieces
of information that might contain or reference other pieces of
information. There are three essential kinds of relationships in which
object definitions (by their instantiable subtypes) can be involved:</p>
<ul>
  <li><b>Assignment
of other objects</b> - an assignment
relationship (<i>IfcRelAssigns</i>) that
refers to other types of objects and creates a bi-directional
association. The semantic of the assignment is established at the level
of the subtypes of the general <i>IfcRelAssigns</i>
relationship. There is no dependency implied a priori by the assignment.</li>
  <li><b>Association
to external resources</b> - an
association relationship (<i>IfcRelAssociates</i>)
that refers to external sources of information (most notably a
classification
or document) and creates a uni-directional association. There is no
dependency implied by the association.</li>
  <li><b>Aggregation
of other objects</b> - an
aggregation relationship (<i>IfcRelDecomposes</i>)
that establishes a whole/part relation and creates a bi-directional
relation. There is an implied dependency established.</li>
</ul>
