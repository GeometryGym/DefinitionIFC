	 <P><U>Definition from IAI</U>: The <I>IfcResource</I> contains the
		information needed to represent the costs, schedule, and other impacts from the
		use of a thing in a process. It is not intended to use <I>IfcResource</I> to
		model the general properties of the things themselves, while an optional
		linkage from <I>IfcResource</I> to the things to be used can be specified (i.e.
		the relationship from subtypes of <I>IfcResource</I> to <I>IfcProduct</I>
		through the <I>IfcRelAssignsToResource</I> relationship). </P> 
	 <P>There are two basic intended use of <I>IfcResource</I>. First, if the
		attributes of the thing are not needed for the purpose of the use of
		<I>IfcResource</I>, or the types of things are not explicitly modeled in IFC
		yet, then the linkage between the resource and the thing doesn&#146;t have to
		be instantiated in the system. That is, the attributes of <I>IfcResource</I>
		(or its subtypes) alone are sufficient to represent the use of the thing as a
		resource for the purpose of the project. </P>

		  vehicles or tools are not currently modeled within the IFC. For the purpose of
		  estimating and scheduling, these can be represented using subtypes of
		  IfcResource alone.</FONT></P></BLOCKQUOTE> 
	 <P> Second, if the attributes of the thing are needed for the use of
		<I>IfcResource</I> objects, and they are modeled explicitly as objects (e.g.
		classes or properties), then the <I>IfcResource</I> instances can be linked to
		the instances of the type of the things being referenced. Things that might be
		used as resources and that are already modeled in the IFC include physical
		products, people and organizations, and materials. The relationship object
		<I>IfcRelAssignsToResource</I> is provided for this approach.</P> 
	 <P>The inherited attribute <I>ObjectType</I> is used as a textual code that
		identifies the resource type. </P>
