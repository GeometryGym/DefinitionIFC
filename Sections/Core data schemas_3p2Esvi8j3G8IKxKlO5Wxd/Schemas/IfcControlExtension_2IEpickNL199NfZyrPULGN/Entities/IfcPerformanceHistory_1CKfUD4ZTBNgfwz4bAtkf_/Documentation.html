<P><U>Definition from IAI</U>: The <I>IfcPerformanceHistory</I> is used to document the actual performance of an occurrence instance over time. In practice, performance-related data are generally not easy to obtain as they can originate from different sources (e.g. predicted, simulated, or measured) and occur during different stages of the building life-cycle. Such time-related data cover a large spectrum, including meteorological data, schedules, operational status measurements, trend reports, etc.
